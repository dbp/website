## Building the OzRacer RV

From [these plans](http://www.duckworksbbs.com/plans/storer/ozracer_rv/index.htm) (a $20 download).

### Summary and some notes

There wasn't much information out there about this build, even though it seems
like a lot of people have made them. In particular, I had no idea how long I
should expect it to take (and I underestimated how long it would take -- the
only number I saw was 10 days, which perhaps a professional, or someone with a
helper, could do, but not me!). So this page is an attempt to give more
information that might be useful to someone taking on this project. In the end,
with every step, including a bunch of time spent stripping off poorly adhered
paint and repainting (probably around 15hrs lost), to a rigged boat ready to
launch, it took **150.75 hours**. As a total amateur.


Also, the plans are pretty detailed, but they aren't perfect -- there are places
where they are incomplete, or misleading (e.g., they suggest gluing in the mast
step at two different places in the plans -- I chose the first one arbitrarily!
Even worse, the rudder box instructions say, counter to the pictures, you should
glue the framing on _after_ gluing the box together. But if you do that, it's
impossible to drill a countersunk hole on the _inside_ of the rudderbox. So the
proposed assembly instructions are essentially impossible) So read everything
and try to understand how things fit together -- it's not a matter of just
following the instructions in order. However, I am confident that they include
enough information that a complete novice (like me) can end up with a boat, but
it probably won't match what is describe exactly, because I don't think what is
describe is actually consistent. Somewhat frustrating, especially given how much
love people give to the plan author (as an engineering spec, at least the type I
would expect from my entirely different background as a software engineering, I
would give it a C-).

Another unclear part is when you should be epoxying things! In the appendix, the
author says that they strongly prefer coating surfaces at the point that they
are getting glued to other things, but then the instructions (and images) don't
seem to do that. Some surfaces really should be done that way, because then they
will become in internal places, but others may be better to wait (I realize now,
perhaps the inside of sealed compartments need not have been coated at all!
Assuming no leaks, they should never see water, and it would have saved time and
weight to not coat them). I ended up coating most everything (on both sides)
before assembly, somewhat ignoring the advice that places where pieces will
later get attached should get masked off (confusingly, one of the main sources
of information, aside from the plans, is this
site:
[http://www.bitingmidge.com/boats/ozracer/building/oneminute.html](http://www.bitingmidge.com/boats/ozracer/building/oneminute.html),
which suggests pre-coating the _entire_ plywood panels. This might have actually
been a much better plan, but clearly contradicts the idea that you shouldn't
pre-coat areas that will get glued. It's also probably somewhat wasteful, as
even scrap parts get coated, and it may make things harder to cut, as epoxy
makes the wood a lot stronger). I then sanded the panels before they got glued to other parts, and hopefully it's all strong enough!


### Tools Used (in order of frequency):

- Drill
- Jig Saw
- Belt Sander
- Orbital Sander
- Router
- Table saw -- to rip lumber to the right dimensions (done all at once the first
  day, as I didn't own one when I started this)
- Hand plane
- Thickness planer (to get the foil blanks to right thickness)
- Electric plane

Note: I ended up not using the hand plane for any of the initial steps, even
though the plans had you using it all the time. The one I bought was crappy and
the sharpening guide I bought didn't fit it, so sharpening was hard. So I used
the jig saw / belt sander for most things (cutting down to close, using sander
for the rest), and for narrowing the mast pieces which I used the router. For
making the foils, however, I ended up using the hand plane for the leading edge.
For the trailing edge, I used an electric hand plane, but to get the curve on
the leading edge, even the not great hand plane worked much better, with a
sander used to clean it up. And then for rounding the yard and shaping the oars,
I used it, crappy as it was (lots of tear-out cleaned up by sanding), a LOT.

### Cost

    Amount                    Description
----------  -------           ------
$20         Duckworks         Plans
$368.65     Duckworks         Fiberglass tape, cloth, wood flour, sail tape, thread, rigging hardware, 3 gallons of marinepoxy, two 6" deck plates (and over $50 shipping!)
$216.74     Local lumberyard  Plywood (four 1/4" plywood sheets) and all lumber
$97.34      Amazon            Topside marine primer, paint (white & red), non-stick additive
$55         Amazon            Wood glue, grommets, painters tape, duct tape, heavy duty needles, 2" screws, 3/4" screws.
~$150       Home depot        Plastic drop cloth, disposable gloves, sand paper (belt & discs), rollers (pant & adhesive), brushes, tack cloth, silicone glue, etc. Some of these weren't used up.
$38.01      Tarpsnow.com      16'x20' white tarp
$42.09      Duckworks         Rudder hardware (from Duckworks, RL-390-GW, fasteners, shipping)
$57.70      Duckworks         Oar hardware, cleats, 70' of line
~$15.00     Home depot        8' 2x8 doug fir for oars
~$15.00     Home depot        12' 1x4 select pine to rip/glue for yard
Total:       **$1045.53**

This was quite a bit more than I was expecting (which, based on things I had
read, made me think it'd be about $500). Part of that is probably that I got
marine paint, which is expensive, vs. regular outdoor house paint (which
probably would have been fine, and probably would have saved ~$80), but also not
thinking about all the disposable stuff (brushes, rollers, drop cloths, gloves)
which, on it's own isn't expensive, but adds up. Finally, the rigging stuff,
deck hatches, and rudder hardware is not cheap ($51 for rope & blocks, $35 for
rudder stuff, $20 for two 6" hatches)! Those things account for about $300,
which combined with probably paying more for lumber than strictly necessary (I
got high quality 5/4ths stuff for the foils, which was not cheap, and I probably
could have just gotten more 2x4s and ripped them. The plywood was just under
$100, and there really wasn't that much other lumber necessary) and a lot of
miscellaneous things (like $8.65 for seam tape for the sail, $5 for high quality
thread, etc) account for the "extra".

#### Extra cost

The initial paint job I did both didn't come out well (I think it was way too
hot when I painted it, especially the top, which I did outside in the sun!), and
I realized that the color on top really didn't look right. So I decided to
scrape/sand off the paint and repaint it. Since this was turning into a much
longer term project, I decided to spend more time researching and decided to
paint it with old-school marine paint from the local shop Kirby paints (which
has been operating continuously since 1846). It's a bit more expensive than the
original stuff I got, but the colors are a lot nicer. Getting a couple quarts,
plus thinner, and
some brushes was about another $100.

### Photos of progress

![](/static/boat/boat-1.jpg) Getting all the lumber, post stripping it with a
table saw my dad had. Without access to a table saw and someone who knows how to
use it, I don't think this project would be possible -- the dimensions of lumber
needed are _not_ things that are available standard. And, even if they were,
they would probably be so much more expensive. For example, I got 12" wide pine
planks that were then ripped to get the 3/4" by 3/4" strips, the 3/4" by 1 3/4",
etc.
<div class="clear"></div>

![](/static/boat/boat-4.jpg) Marking side panels (first mistake is present in
this photo -- third and possibly fourth clamp are not in the right place, and
the flexible wood batten was so flexible that I was able to make the shape. The
bottom is supposed to be a smooth curve! All other panels marked to match this
one, replicating the mistake.)

<div class="clear"></div>

![](/static/boat/boat-5.jpg) Making more side panels.

<div class="clear"></div>

![](/static/boat/boat-6.jpg) Sanding all side panels to be identical. This was
supposed to be done with a plane, but I couldn't get that to work. The sander
worked though!

<div class="clear"></div>

![](/static/boat/boat-7.jpg) Cutting forward bulkhead.

<div class="clear"></div>

![](/static/boat/boat-8.jpg) Epoxying rear transom & forward bulkhead.

<div class="clear"></div>

![](/static/boat/boat-9.jpg) Epoxying side panels, attaching framing.

<div class="clear"></div>

![](/static/boat/boat-10.jpg) Sanding panels, transoms, bulkhead.

<div class="clear"></div>

![](/static/boat/boat-11.jpg) Boat is 3D! No bottom yet though.

<div class="clear"></div>

![](/static/boat/boat-12.jpg) After long and hard day, added mast step /
partner, epoxied bottom and with help of dad (**this would not have been
possible alone, as we had to wrench it into shape and then put in screws to hold
it**), attached bottom (involving a bit of work to get the boat square, and then
a lot more work to get the bottom to attach to the sides due to the mistake
shaping the bottom; had to add more trim and screw through the bottom to get it
to pull up to side panels.)

<div class="clear"></div>

![](/static/boat/boat-13.jpg) Dry fitting deck.

<div class="clear"></div>

![](/static/boat/boat-14.jpg) Epoxying bottom of deck.

<div class="clear"></div>

![](/static/boat/boat-15.jpg) Adding fiberglass tape to seams, epoxying bottom
of boat.

<div class="clear"></div>

![](/static/boat/boat-16.jpg) Scarfing mast pieces together and cutting to
length. (Though, not pictured here I narrowed them with a router, and messed up
the narrowest part, so I think I'm going to switch to a lug sail which requires
shorter masts, and thus I can cut off the mistake!)

<div class="clear"></div>

![](/static/boat/boat-17.jpg) Priming bottom of boat.

<div class="clear"></div>

![](/static/boat/boat-18.jpg) Painted & flipped the boat (it's gotten heavy!
Problem with getting plywood from a local lumberyard is that thinnest they had
was 1/4", and I'm sure it's not the lightest stuff!)

<div class="clear"></div>

![](/static/boat/boat-19.jpg) Moved outside to paint top.

<div class="clear"></div>

![](/static/boat/boat-20.jpg) Primed top and inside.

<div class="clear"></div>

![](/static/boat/boat-21.jpg) Painted top and inside.

<div class="clear"></div>

![](/static/boat/boat-22.jpg) Some really crappy paddles made out of scrap ply,
extra 3/4" square with some epoxy added and fiberglass tape wrapped around
handle (though I was lazy and only did a single coat of epoxy, so fiberglass
tape is still very present. It also hadn't fully dried when we took it out the
next day, so I wrapped duct tape around the handle and halfway down the shaft,
so it wouldn't feel sticky!)

<div class="clear"></div>

![](/static/boat/boat-23.jpg) Testing the hull out. Found a minor leak in the
left side tank (I hadn't cut the leeboard slot yet, so it wasn't that). It ended
up being at the end.

<div class="clear"></div>


![](/static/boat/boat-24.jpg) Cut top of leeboard slot, and added fiberglass along edge.

<div class="clear"></div>

![](/static/boat/boat-25.jpg) Cut bottom of leeboard slot. I noticed what looked
like slight gaps at some points around the leeboard case. I'm not sure if they
go all the way through to the tank, but I added some thickened epoxy. I'll have
to test the watertightness by dumping water into the tank and see if any comes
out!

<div class="clear"></div>

![](/static/boat/boat-26.jpg) Sewing the sail. This took a long time and a _lot_ of sewing! But the result seemed to come out pretty well, modulo some mistakes (i.e., the tall reinforcing panel that runs most of the way through this photo should have gone higher so the curve at the top hit the top edge of the sail a bit higher than it did).

<div class="clear"></div>

![](/static/boat/boat-27.jpg) Planing foils. This would have been much easier if
my hand plane was better, but I made do by using it on the leading edge (just
for the actual curve, which had very narrow shavings that it did better on) and
the electric hand planer on the rest, and on the trailing edge. They probably aren't perfect, but they look pretty good!

<div class="clear"></div>
