About this part

#### Important Notes (!!! READ THESE EVEN IF YOU IGNORE THE REST !!!)

- Honestly, there wasn't much to be done here -- obviously, if you want a
  perfect finish, do the work _before_ you start painting (i.e., keep working on
  fairing, etc).


### Photos of building sequence, with notes

![First, a lot of scraping down fillets. I thought I was going to really pay for doing slightly messy work, but this rounded tiny carbide scraper turned out perfect and it actually wasn't that hard.](/static/apple/IMG_8294.jpeg)

<div style="clear: both"></div>


![Then, some fairing to hide the internal glass tape. I did this _strategically -- not in the bilge, or up under the rear thwarts, where it won't be visible (I still sanded those down, but didn't try to fair them to be invisible).](/static/apple/IMG_8303.jpeg)

![Finally, three coats of epoxy, with sanding in between. Getting the sequence of this right so I wasn't trying to put my hand or feet in places I had already coated with trickier than I thought it would be, but my eventual strategy was to do overhanging places first (everywhere) and then go outside to the middle (where my stepladder is on the side). The overhangs are hard to get without leaning, grabbing parts, etc.](/static/apple/IMG_8309.jpeg)

![Then it was time to install deck hardware and start priming the inside. I used the same two coats of primer on the inside as outside.](/static/apple/IMG_8389.jpeg)

![And, finally, three coats of white on the inside. Three looked pretty good, and I was running out of time for my rowing-only launch date, so I stopped. ](/static/apple/IMG_8463.jpeg)
