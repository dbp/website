**Total Time: 12.75 hours**

This is a pretty short part of the process, but the breasthook is one of the most visible parts of the boat!

#### Important Notes (!!! READ THESE EVEN IF YOU IGNORE THE REST !!!)

- If you want to have a chamfered lower section of the stem (to cut through the water
  better), figure out that shape before you glue the wood on the boat: I tried a
  chamfer and it looked quite bad, so ended up laminating back on strips of
  khaya to build back to something big enough that I could trim to a square
  stem.

![The outer (false) step did not appear in the plans outside  the instruction sequence. I got details from Tom, including suggestions to chamfer the lower section into a sharp edge. I tried that, but couldn't get it to look right, so just ended up with a square from (20ish mm wide) with rounded corners.](/static/apple/IMG_0594.jpeg)

![I continued that into the forward part of the keel, which was glued down (with lots of weights carefully balanced on the 20mm square top), then reinforced with glass tape. This ends where the centerboard slot begins. When I was doing this, I wasn't sure if the centerboard would require a different sized slot (I thought I was going to need to design it myself, rather than getting a design from Tom), so diverged from the plans and flipped the boat, deferring the rest of the bottom stuff (glassing, skeg), until later. With what I know now, I would probably do the ordinary sequence, building the centercase at this point.](/static/apple/IMG_0617.jpeg)

![For the breasthook, I wanted to shape it to curve up along the line that the gunwale followed (as it is dropping down along the sides), so I fit it in proud, and then used a power planer and sander to shape it. Also, given my lazy craftsmanship: rather than getting the joint perfect, I cut it close enough and added a ton of thickened epoxy to fill the gaps.](/static/apple/IMG_0631.jpeg)

![Also, I noticed after gluing in the breaksthook that I had shaped the back of it backwards, so much later, cut the curve to fit (also, this photo shows the nose: both it and the breaksthook need tuning, but are close).](/static/apple/IMG_2137.jpeg)
