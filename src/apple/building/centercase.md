About this part

#### Important Notes (!!! READ THESE EVEN IF YOU IGNORE THE REST !!!)

- As mentioned in the [Boat](/apple/boat.html) section, not only am I putting
  in a pivoting centerboard (with design provided by Tom), but I'm using the
  removable centerboard design popular in Francois Vivier's boats, where there
  is a slot in the side of the case where a pin that protrudes from the side of
  the board comes out.

### Photos of building sequence, with notes

<div style="clear: both"></div>

![This photo shows the shape of the slot, which I reinforced with another layer
of 6mm plywood (so there is 12mm of bearing surface on either side) before
capping with hardwood.](/static/apple/IMG_2400.jpeg)

<div style="clear: both"></div>

![The case itself is framed in pretty stout douglas fir; another exterior
stringer will be added later.](/static/apple/IMG_2587.jpeg)

<div style="clear: both"></div>

![In a really interesting (and, I think much easier to make watertight) method, a hole for the case is cut in the hull and it is dropped clear through.](/static/apple/IMG_3254.jpeg)

<div style="clear: both"></div>

![This means later, once it is glued in, the excess is cut off the outside, and the hull to centercase joint is exposed to the bottom, so it is much easier to seal.](/static/apple/IMG_7634.jpeg)

<div style="clear: both"></div>

![The joint can then be filled, and should be rounded and then glassed (give it a good round -- probably with a trim router -- as I didn't round mine much and then had trouble getting the glass to lay down well)](/static/apple/IMG_7636.jpeg)

<div style="clear: both"></div>

![Back inside, you can see the stringer that runs along the side, and how it is filleted to the hull, to the semi bulkhead towards the front and glued to the bulkhead at the back.](/static/apple/IMG_7418.jpeg)
