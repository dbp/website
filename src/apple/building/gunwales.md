**Total Time: 27.75 hours**

The gunwales are pretty easy -- my time estimate should be high, as I had a bit
of a disaster with the first wood I was trying to use kept breaking.

#### Important Notes (!!! READ THESE EVEN IF YOU IGNORE THE REST !!!)

- Be sure the wood you have bends well, as there is a compound curve near
  bulkhead 10 that kept breaking the first wood I tried to use (or just steam
  it).

![After finishing spot filleting and taping between the wires, it's time to put on the gunwales. I made a bit of a mistake here, getting some too brittle douglas fir that just kept cracking. I'm sure if I could steam it, or perhaps it wasn't as cold in my shop, or any number of other options, but I ended up eventually giving up and doing layers of eastern white pine capped by outer layers of african mahogany (khaya). As part of my experimenting, I kept making thinner strips, and ended up doing that with the pine/khaya as well, though I'm sure that was unnecessary (the pine, at least, was very bendy). I also didn't make the strips quite long enough, hence the gap in the front, but eventually cut a piece of khaya to fit](/static/apple/IMG_0477.jpeg)

![And then the final step before flipping: the quarter knees. I cut slots to fit the inwales, but realized later that the inwales will slant up at the end (since the hull is not plumb at the transom, but sloping out), so if you want them to smoothly transition into the quarter knees, the quarter knees should really go with the curved transom, rather than flat, and have the quarter knees match the angle that the inwale will have. But it's nothing I'm losing sleep over -- structurally, they are sound (probably oversized, but they are nice hand-holds).](/static/apple/IMG_0485.jpeg)
