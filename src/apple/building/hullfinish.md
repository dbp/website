About this part

#### Important Notes (!!! READ THESE EVEN IF YOU IGNORE THE REST !!!)

- The designer mentions you could have a single continuous keel running all the
  way front to back. I didn't do that, but regretted it once trying to use this
  on trailer rollers. I'm planning on replacing the rollers with a single plank,
  which will eliminate the problem (essentially, the discontinuous pieces of
  keel bump up and down over the rollers), but if you aren't, I'd aim to avoid
  the problem by having the forward keel connect to that on either side of the
  centercase, and have that in turn connect to the skeg.

![Pieces on either side of the centercase -- rather than cutting them on a
curve, since the curve was gently enough I just forced down the ends and screwed
the other ends of the 2x4s to the rafters](/static/apple/IMG_7782.jpeg)

![Glassing the rear section first -- note that for time (I work in usually 1 hr
increments), I glassed in sections, overlapping slightly each
time](/static/apple/IMG_7762.jpeg)

![And then gluing down the skeg, which I had cut a template for and
shaped](/static/apple/IMG_7815.jpeg)

![The rest of the glass went on in sections. I often missed the fill coat
window, or didn't fill with enough (slightly thickened) epoxy to get a proper
chemical bond, but I was close, using pretty good low-blush epoxy, and it all
seemed to work out.](/static/apple/IMG_7997.jpeg)

![Next up sanding (after waiting a while for the epoxy to cure) -- paying particular attention to the joints between the fiberglass sections. I didn't end up with invisible overlaps, but close enough...](/static/apple/IMG_8100.jpeg)

![And, starting with the primer. I did two coats of System 3's Yacht primer, rolling and tipping. It dries a little fast, which makes it hard to get a perfect finish, but it certainly gets a good enough finish. Each full coat took a little over an hour.](/static/apple/IMG_8123.jpeg)

<div style="clear: both"></div>

![Finally, the top coat. I did four coats, _not_ sanding between, as the System 3 WR-LPU (which they are phasing out for something similar) has a chemical bond recoat window, and that saved me a ton of time -- no runs, minimal brush marks, and overall, quite happy!](/static/apple/IMG_8148.jpeg)

![The keel band I made out 1/8" x 3/4" 316 stainless, which was easy to get, cheap, easy to _bend_, but a huge pain to drill (if I had a drill press, I might feel differently). In the end, I got it to work.](/static/apple/IMG_8229.jpeg)
