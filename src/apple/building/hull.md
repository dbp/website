**Total Time: 62 hours**

Building the hull is pretty straightforward -- while it certainly takes some
time, once you get the strakes cut out, it goes together very quickly.

#### Important Notes (!!! READ THESE EVEN IF YOU IGNORE THE REST !!!)

- The offsets where you are marking the points for the strakes are the station
  marks, which will be used to key the bulkheads, etc. That's why they are at
  sometimes odd not-quite even numbers. 
- It is mentioned in the plans, but it is super important (and I missed it!):
  **mark vertical lines connecting each pair of station points**. 
  
  If, like me,
  you marked on one set of scarfed sheets and then cut through both at once,
  this means you need to flip one set of strakes over (once you've marked the
  edge on the bottom strakes) and draw the lines on the _opposite_ site as you
  were marking points on the top (otherwise you'll have the inside on one side
  and the outside of the other). This will be critical when you are wiring in
  the bulkheads, but is also useful just in aligning the panels together.
- If you don't need to move the hull while you are doing the glass between the
  stitches, there is no need to tack with fast epoxy or hot glue. This advice is
  in the case that you are building in a single car garage (amazing that it can
  be done) where work can only be done on one side. Otherwise, if you can level
  and stabilize the boat once it is wired and then do all of the 50mm tape
  between the wires without disturbing the boat, you can skip that.


### Photos of building sequence, with notes

![I did glass butt joints and it worked out well; not only is it easier than scarfing, it gains extra length on the sheets, which I was worried about because I didn't want to have to have the missing triangle at the front of the top strake; as it turned out, due to having european 2500mm plywood, it would have been fine scarfed](/static/apple/IMG_0106.jpg)

<div style="clear: both"></div>

![I cut all the panels with a 6.5" circular saw with a 60T blade, with one scarfed sheet clamped on the other. This could easily handle the curves, and I generally kept very close to the line to minimize the planing that would be necessary later. The hand saw was for the few places where the plywood flexed and so the saw didn't fully cut the bottom sheet](/static/apple/IMG_0160.jpeg)

<div style="clear: both"></div>

![Unsurprisingly, I used too much epoxy for the butt joints, but better too much than too little. The combination of heat gun and scraper worked pretty well (only one slight scorch in one spot, on all the strakes), though I was careful to not heat up the epoxy that was in the glass as I didn't want to weaken it.](/static/apple/IMG_0195.jpeg)


<div style="clear: both"></div>

![The hull goes together quickly at this point. Glass on the upper front edge of strake 0 can be seen here -- I was a little unsure about what upper edge meant, but what is in this photo was correct, as I could see the strain it was under later on in the process.](/static/apple/IMG_0232.jpeg)

<div style="clear: both"></div>

![Working alone, the strakes are very wobbly: one technique that I realized later was using a spring clamp (or several) on the lower strake towards the rear to hold the currently-being-wired strake in as the next gets wired. In email, Tom emphasized to wire from front to back, which I was able to once I had that issue worked out.](/static/apple/IMG_0274.jpeg)

<div style="clear: both"></div>

![After three strakes, bulkheads 10, 4, and the transom go in. I had temporary plywood formers, as specified, until this point. These bulkheads will align with the station lines that hopefully you marked before you cut out the strakes and transfered to the other set!](/static/apple/IMG_0261.jpeg)

<div style="clear: both"></div>

![A note about wires: I started out by buying some copper from Duckworks. It often broke on more extreme bends, and I ran out quickly. Since the design calls for glassing between the wires, then removing them, there is no risk of having any wire left in the hull, so I just got rebar wire from the hardware store. It's pretty heavy gauge -- certainly as strong as I needed (I could pull through the plywood before the wire broke). I ended up replacing most of the copper wires when I was tightening up the hull later on. If you were planning on bright finishing the boat, it is perhaps a bad idea, as it did leave a slight black stain, but I'm not, so no issue for me.](https://dbp.io/static/apple/IMG_0254.jpeg)

<div style="clear: both"></div>

![The first real treat in the build: once the hull is wired together, the transition into the plumb bow really is a thing of beauty (who said plywood couldn't do compound curves!)](/static/apple/IMG_0281.jpeg)

<div style="clear: both"></div>


![You also, of course, get a good sense of the whole shape of the boat -- you won't really get a better sense for a long time, so appreciate the milestone, and how quickly it has come!](/static/apple/IMG_0285.jpeg)

<div style="clear: both"></div>


![Now the somewhat time consuming step: filleting the bulkheads between the wires and glassing the strakes between the wires. I opted for big fillets and skipping the glass on the bulkheads, as it seemed easier, and based on the longevity of Goat Island Skiffs (see [Comparison](/apple/comparison.html)), I'm pretty sure the Apple 16 is somewhat over-built, strength-wise!)](/static/apple/IMG_0293.jpeg)

At this point, sequentially, you will do the
[Gunwales](/apple/building/gunwales.html), before flipping the boat, but I
organized the time for the Hull to include all of the glass taping, which
happens over the course of two more flips.

<div style="clear: both"></div>

![Time to flip the boat! It's quite light, and with two people, would be very easy to do. Alone,  it is stiff enough to just roll it onto its side, though I would suggest rolling it onto cardboard (on my next roll I did), both to protect the gunwales, and more importantly make it easy to slide it over.](/static/apple/IMG_0491.jpeg)

<div style="clear: both"></div>

![Glassing the outer seams isn't hard, though it is time consuming -- pictured here is once I was finished (not sanded though yet), including filling with epoxy mixed with fairing filler (I did epoxy, then glass, then fill dry spots; once it cured, another layer of unthickened epoxy, once that cured, filled with epoxy mixed with fairing filler to make sanding easier).](/static/apple/IMG_0531.jpeg)


<div style="clear: both"></div>

Again, while working on the outer seams, it makes sense to do the [Outer
stem](/apple/building/hull.html). Technically, it could probably be deferred to
later, but this is the order Tom suggests, and I don't see any reason not to.
This is also when he suggested to install the centercase (cutting the slot from
the top and bringing the case up from underneath), glassing the hull, and
putting on the skeg, but I _did_ defer all of those things.

---
<div style="clear: both"></div>


![Once all the outer seams have been fully coated, and the hull has been flipped (and possibly more stuff has been done: stem, perhaps centercase, hull glassed, etc), it's time to sand down the short glass tapes and short fillets and do full length tape over top and full length fillets in the gaps. I sanded with a random orbital sander -- I wasn't that concerned about cutting a little bit into the weave, because there should be so much strength from the 3" full length tape (doubled at the centerline and first chine) and it made it a lot quicker.](/static/apple/IMG_0637.jpeg)


<div style="clear: both"></div>

![Then it's just a matter of laying down glass tape -- easier, in some ways, than the short segments!](/static/apple/IMG_0650.jpeg)

<div style="clear: both"></div>

At this point, the hull is quite strong -- it'll obviously get stronger from knees, thwarts, tanks, floors, etc, and I haven't felt confident getting into it (but also have been able to reach from the side for everything I've needed). Also, as additional (unintentional) confirmation: before building support cradles onto my saw horses, I accidentally dropped the back of the boat off onto the concrete floor (so, about an 18" drop). There was no damage anywhere, which is good!
