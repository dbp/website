About this part

#### Important Notes (!!! READ THESE EVEN IF YOU IGNORE THE REST !!!)

- You (probably) need to install the rudder post before gluing in the mizzen
  partner, assuming you want to screw in from the inside in addition to gluing
  on the outside (as is suggested by the designer). The design for the rear tank
  I used keeps this area accessible, in theory, but it is a _lot_ harder to get
  to once the partner (and then tank top) is on.

### Photos of building sequence, with notes

<div style="clear: both"></div>

![This photo gives a good sense of how I was arranging the stern: two sealed
tanks with an open channel in the middle which houses the mizzen step, so if
water runs down from the mizzen mast, it can drain out. The tank sides also
provide support for the seat tops and the mizzen partner (additional framing
will go over the tank tops).](/static/apple/IMG_1923.jpeg)

<div style="clear: both"></div>

![The mizzen partner and step are shown here (not glued or epoxy coated yet!): they have a 5.75 degree rake, which corresponds to 50mm rake back a half-meter up, which happens to be what my fake mizzenmast is. I used two layers of ply and then a layer of solid wood for the partner (plus, the tank top will be another layer of ply on top); the step is three layers of ply sitting on top of a base of khaya, where the bottom two layers of ply have a drainage channel cut.](/static/apple/IMG_2156.jpeg)

<div style="clear: both"></div>

![To cut the angle on the mizzen step and partner once I had glued them together, I made a template based on the rake on the boat and matched that when filing away.](/static/apple/IMG_2330.jpeg)

<div style="clear: both"></div>

![The front faces of the tanks have hatches: the Armstrong hatches I'm using don't have any permanent attachments in the boat (and seal very well), but still need reinforcing rings. Unfortunately, in the attempt to keep the hatches clear of potential side tanks and floorboards, I went a little close to the top/side, not accounting for the stringers. There is still enough room for the internal arm of the hatches to fit at two positions, but not at every position as normal.](/static/apple/IMG_2383.jpeg)

![Then everything on the inside is primed](/static/apple/IMG_2419.jpeg)

<div style="clear: both"></div>


![And painted. Doing it before gluing anything in meant a few surfaces had to be roughed (I taped some edges, but didn't tape everywhere), but made the painting much quicker and easier.](/static/apple/IMG_2452.jpeg)


<div style="clear: both"></div>

![The stern seat top is supported by the tank sides and by stringers running across the open space. These were roughly beveled to fit the outer edge (which ongles in two directions), but thickened epoxy filled any gaps -- spring clamps held them securely in place while the epoxy cured.](/static/apple/IMG_2543.jpeg)


<div style="clear: both"></div>

![At this point, I shaped and cut the rudder post, which is the design for a non-raked rudder. Tom suggested in the case of a centerboard, this would be better, and Matt Bowser described issues he'd had with the entire rudder popping off (rather than kicking up) with the raked rudder. I used ~30mm maple that I had, which is perhaps not ideal boat building wood, but it'll be entirely encapsulated in epoxy and paint, and it certainly is hard! I put three screws in from the inside by first drilling holes along the (marked) centerline from the outside and then holding the rudder post on as square as possible and drilling from the inside out into the rudder post. Once that was on, the mizzen partner went on, making the screws a lot harder to get to.](/static/apple/IMG_2698.jpeg)

<div style="clear: both"></div>

![Not mentioned in this sequence is all the filleting that had to happen: along every edge that didn't have a stringer. I didn't bother to paint over the fillets, but I did use pure silica as the thickener so that it somewhat blended in to the off-white paint! Then it is time to glue on the tank top, after coating every exposed stringer with thickened epoxy. Since getting inside the tanks to clean up squeeze out would be difficult at best, I didn't put a ton of epoxy on; obviously I want good connections, but if there were tiny gaps it isn't a huge deal. Indeed, only at the front edge and along the middle ahead of the partner would it compromise the tank watertightness, since the upper edge will be filleted around the outer edge.](/static/apple/IMG_2746.jpeg)

![Then the screws come out, holes filled, mizzen hole cut, and outer edge filleted. Note, of course, that this fillet hides any minor imperfections in the tank top fit.](/static/apple/IMG_2788.jpeg)
