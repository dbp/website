## My Boat

While certainly many details on this site will be relevant to any variety of
Apple 16, some may not, so it's important to highlight the boat I'm building:

1. 4 plank per side "Apple AHL" as it's described in some of Tom's pages, rather
   than the 5 plank "Swedish Apple" (or the gaff cutter -- which doesn't
   describe the hull, but rather what goes above!). The 5 plank Apple requires 6
   sheets of ply for planks, rather than 4 sheets for the 4 plank Apple: given that
   the marine ply I'm using (Occume) is tropical hardwood, minimizing it is a no
   brainer (I'm sure I would use off-cuts in the 5 plank version). I was also
   just amazed by the way that Tom nested the planks into the sheets, and how
   that turned into such a beautiful 3D shape -- often the planks would be less
   than an inch from each other in multiple places.
2. Single (large) rig, with a small mizzen. This is shown in the picture above. The
   plans account for a larger mizzen "light-air" rig, and corresponding multiple
   daggerboard positions -- something I did not want to deal with!
3. Pivoting centerboard, rather than a daggerboard. The design in the plans
   calls for a long daggerboard case to accommodate the two rig options, so the
   centerboard case doesn't actually take up more room in the boat. While it
   isn't in the plan set (or at least, wasn't when I bought them), when I asked
   Tom about a centerboard he sent me CAD drawings he had made based on old
   sketches (for two different options), so I didn't actually have to do any
   designing: his design, conveniently, had the same slot size in the hull.
4. An enclosed rear tank seat (technically, two rear tanks, with an open channel
   for the mizzen step to drain), enclosed bow tank, open rear side seats and
   mid-ship thwart, but no seats forward of the middle of the boat. Related to this---
5. Floorboards! Sitting on the floor of the boat seems nice for children and
   dogs, both of which I have -- especially forward of the middle thwart,
   the hull starts to get steep, so sitting without thwarts requires
   floorboards. Also, that way you don't have to sit in bilge water!
6. The mast partner is a slight deviation: I'm using the mast gate used by Iain
   Oughtred, as it allows the mast to be stepped by first placing the butt is
   the step and then lifting up the mast (the back of the mast partner is open).
   As a result of this change, I did deviate a bit in the bow, as I made the
   mast partner be part of one continuous king-plank, rather than one of the
   plywood options that are in the plans.
7. For the tiller, rather than the curved one that goes around the mizzen mast,
   I'm going to put in a Norwegian-style push-pull tiller. This seems easier,
   and should allow more room for seating further back in the boat. 


## Materials

- Plywood: 6 sheets 2500mm x 1225mm (8ft x 4ft "metric") 6mm thick. 
- Solid wood: 16ft (should have 17ft!) for gunwales, in & out. 6 strips
  20mmx20mm. Quarter knees, breast hook, and king plank mahogany. 25mm x 25mm
  douglas fir for centercase support, and lots of 20mm x 20mm stringers (I had a
  disasterous attempt to use way to brittle douglas fir for gunwales, so had
  plenty of this stuff), white oak for floors, ipe for floorboards.
- Epoxy (to be updated as I go along):  6G (not all used yet)
- Fiberglass: XX 3" tape, XX 2" tape, XX 50" yards
