## My Boat

While certainly many details on this site will be relevant to any variety of
Apple 16, some may not, so it's important to highlight the boat I'm building:

1. 4 plank per side "Apple AHL" as it's described in some of Tom's pages, rather
   than the 5 plank "Swedish Apple" (or the gaff cutter -- which doesn't
   describe the hull, but rather what goes above!). The 5 plank Apple requires 6
   sheets of ply for planks, rather than 4 sheets for the 4 plank Apple: given that
   the marine ply I'm using (Occume) is tropical hardwood, minimizing it is a no
   brainer (I'm sure I would use off-cuts in the 5 plank version). I was also
   just amazed by the way that Tom nested the planks into the sheets, and how
   that turned into such a beautiful 3D shape -- often the planks would be less
   than an inch from each other in multiple places.
2. Single (large) rig, with a small mizzen. This is shown in the picture on the main page. The
   plans account for a larger mizzen "light-air" rig, and corresponding multiple
   daggerboard positions -- something I did not want to deal with!
3. Pivoting centerboard, rather than a daggerboard. The design in the plans
   calls for a long daggerboard case to accommodate the two rig options, so the
   centerboard case doesn't actually take up more room in the boat. While it
   isn't in the plan set (or at least, wasn't when I bought them), when I asked
   Tom about a centerboard he sent me CAD drawings he had made based on old
   sketches (for two different options), so I didn't actually have to do any
   designing: his design, conveniently, had the same slot size in the hull.
4. An enclosed rear tank seat (technically, two rear tanks, with an open channel
   for the mizzen step to drain), enclosed bow tank, open rear side seats and
   mid-ship thwart, but no seats forward of the middle of the boat. Related to this---
5. Water ballast, as a tank that runs to the height of the floors from a little
   behind the centerboard case to the front of it. Since the hull starts to get
   steep around the centerboard case, this ends up being good use of otherwise
   not that useful bilge space. This centers the weight around the lowest point
   of the hull, and adds a couple hundred pounds when full. Behind the water
   ballast, a removable plywood "sole" exists with large circles cut in it to
   allow water to drain into the bilge; the circles also act as foot rests when
   rowing.
6. The mast partner is a slight deviation: I'm using a mast gate, similar to how
   I've seen freestanding masts in boats by Francois Vivier (essentially, an
   open end on the back, which gets closed by a big rope across it).
   As a result of this change, I did deviate a bit in the bow, as I made the
   mast partner be part of one continuous king-plank, rather than one of the
   plywood options that are in the plans.
7. For the tiller, rather than the curved one that goes around the mizzen mast,
   I'm going to put in a Norwegian-style push-pull tiller. This seems easier,
   and allows more room for seating further back in the boat. 


## Materials

- Plywood: 8 sheets 2500mm x 1225mm (8ft x 4ft "metric") 6mm thick. 
- Solid wood: 17ft for gunwales, in & out. 6 strips 20mmx20mm. Quarter knees,
  breast hook, and king plank mahogany. 25mm x 25mm douglas fir for centercase
  support, and lots of 20mm x 20mm stringers (I had a disasterous attempt to use
  way to brittle douglas fir for gunwales, so had plenty of this stuff), white
  oak for floors, ipe for floorboards. Strips of lightweight wood for
  centerboard and rudder (I used red cedar).
- Epoxy:  ~8G (this is a rough approximation!)
- Fiberglass: ?? 3" tape, ?? 2" tape, ?? 50" yards
