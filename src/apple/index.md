## About the Campion Apple 16

The Apple 16 is a 15ft 10in lug-yawl designed by Tom Dunderdale of [Campion Boats](http://www.campionboats.co.uk/). The [official webpage](https://www.campionboats.co.uk/apple16.html) is a bit spare.

To buy plans, email Tom: [td@campionboats.co.uk](mailto:td@campionboats.co.uk), you can find the current plan prices here: [http://www.campionboats.co.uk/prices.html](http://www.campionboats.co.uk/prices.html). Tom is very responsive over email, so getting the plans is very easy (note the three options: the plain Apple 16, as described on this website, is the Apple AHL there; the Apple 16 plan set is the regular Apple includes plans for the gaff cutter, and the Swedish Apple has more planks).

## Why This Site

The Apple 16 is an **amazing design**, but for various reasons it seems to be less popular than other boats that fit into the same category (general length, weight, etc), even while it seems to have many advantages (described in [Comparison](/apple/comparison.html) section). But, one problem with building a less popular boat is that there are less community resources, and it's harder to understand, before building, what is going to be involved -- hopefully this site, including a detailed log of my own process, which should give at least rough time estimates (everyone works at different paces, has different standards, tools, etc), should help!

Also, while Tom is incredibly responsive, the plans themselves can be somewhat
overwhelming once you get past the hull (where the step-by-step instructions
stop) -- the issue is that the boat has had tons of different options added over
time (water ballast, 3/4 decking, floorboards, side tanks, etc, etc), and these
all overlap in various ways in the plan sheets. This does mean, if you want to
customize thing, you can often find guidance in the plans (and if not, Tom is
incredibly helpful), but it can be intimidating. So another goal of this site is
to show how to interpret the plans into a single boat: the one that I'm
building, so that if you want to build a similar one, hopefully you have to do
less pondering than I did. I will also include all of the communication that I
have had with Tom (clarifying details, etc), but of course the plans themselves
you will get from him.
