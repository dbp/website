    A Literate Ur/Web Adventure
   </h1>
   <p>
    <a href="http://www.impredicative.com/ur/">Ur/Web</a> is a language /
framework for web programming that both makes it really hard to write
code with bugs / vulnerabilities and also makes it really easy to write
reactive, client-side code, all from a single, simple, codebase. But it
is built on some pretty deep type theory, and while it is an incredibly
practical research project, some corners of it still show - like error
messages that scroll pages off the screen. I’ve experimented with it
before, and have written a small application that is beyond a demo, but
still small enough to be digestible.
   </p>
   <p>
    For completeness and clarity, I present it here in complete literate
style - all the files, interspersed with comments, are presented. They
are split into sections by file, which are named in headings. All the
text between the file name and the next file name that is not actual
code is within comments (that is what the <code>#</code>,
<code>(*</code> and <code>*)</code> are for), so you can copy the whole
thing to the files and build the project. All the files should go into a
single directory. It builds with the current version of Ur/Web. You can
try out the application, as it currently exists (which might have been
changed since writing this), at <a href="http://lab.dbpmail.net/dn">lab.dbpmail.net/dn</a>. The full
source, with history, is available at <a href="https://github.com/dbp/dnplayer">github.com/dbp/dnplayer</a>.
   </p>
   <p>
    The application is a video player for the daily news program <a href="http://democracynow.org">Democracy Now!</a>. The main point of it
is to remember where in the show you are, so you can stop and resume it,
across devices. It should work on desktop and mobile applications - I
have targetted Chrome on Android, Chrome on computers, and Safari on
iPhones/iPads. The main reason for not supporting Firefox is that it
does not support the (proprietary) video/audio codecs that are the only
format that Democracy Now! provides.

# They separate meta-data declarations from the modules in the project by
# a single blank line, which is why we have comments on all blank lines

# They also allow you to rewrite urls. By default, urls are generated
# consistently as Module/function_name, which means that the main

# one url to another, but if we leave off the second, that rewrites to
# root. We can also strip prefixes from urls with a rewrite with a *.

# safeGet allows us to declare that a function is safe to generate urls
# to, ie that it won't cause side effects. Along the same safety lines,
# we declare the external urls that we will generate and scripts we will
# include - making injecting resources hosted elsewhere hard (as Ur/Web
# won't allow you to create urls to anything not declared here).

# Next, we declare that we have foreign functions in a module called dnjs. This
# refers to a header file (.urs), and we furthermore declare what functions within
# it we are using. We declare them as effectful so that they aren't called multiple
# times (like Haskell, Ur/Web is purely functional, so normal, non-effectful functions are not
# guaranteed to be called exactly once - they could be optimized away if the compiler
# did not see you use the result of the function, and could be inlined (and thus

    <code>.urs</code> files are header files (signature files), which
declare all the public functions in the module (in this case, the
<code>Dn</code> module). We only export our <code>main</code> function
here, but all functions that have urls that we generate within the
applications are also implicitly exported.
   </p>
   <p>
    The type of main, <code>unit -&gt; transaction page</code>, means
that it takes no input (<code>unit</code> is a value-less value, a
placeholder for argumentless functions), and it produces a
<code>page</code> (which is a collection of xml), within a
<code>transaction</code>. <code>transaction</code>, like Haskell’s IO
monad, is the way that Ur/Web handles IO in a safe way. If you aren’t
familiar with IO in Haskell, you should go there and then come back.

# that we are using functions declared in random.urs (that is the ffi line).
# We also declare that all three functions are effectful, because they have
# side effects
#
# NOTE: It has been pointed out that instead of doing this, we could either:
#       A. use Ur/Web's builtin `rand` function, and construct the strings
#          without using the FFI, or even easier:
#       B. just use the integers than `rand` generates as tokens.
#
#       I didn't realize that `rand` existed when I wrote this, but I'm leaving
#       it in because it is a (concise) introduction to the FFI, which, given

means the former takes no arguments, and the latter two take integers

<code>transactions</code>. They are within <code>transaction</code>
because they create side effects (ie, if you run them twice, you will
likely not get the same result), and thus we want the compiler to treat

    We’ll now jump into the main web application, having seen a little
bit about how the various files are combined together. The first thing
we have is the data that we will be using - one database table, for our
users, and one cookie. The tables are declared with Ur/Web’s record
syntax, where <code>Token</code>, <code>Date</code>, and
<code>Offset</code> are the names of fields, and <code>string</code>,
<code>string</code>, and <code>float</code> are the types.
   </p>
   <p>
    All tables that are going to be used have to be declared, and Ur/Web
will generate SQL to create them. This is, in my opinion, one weakness,
as it means that Ur/Web doesn’t play well with others (as it needs the
tables to be named uw_Module_name), and, even worse, if you rename
modules, or refactor where the tables are stored, the names of the
tables need to change - if you are just creating a toy, you can wipe out
the database and re-initialize it, but obviously this isn’t an option
for something that matters, and you just have to manually migrate the
tables, based on the newly generated database schemas. Luckily the
tables / columns are predictably named, but it still isn’t great.
   </p>
   <pre><code>*)
(* Note: Date is the date string used in the urls, as the most
   convenient serialization, Offset is seconds into the show *)
table u : {Token : string, Date : string, Offset : float} PRIMARY KEY Token
cookie c : string
(*</code></pre>
   <p>
    Ur/Web provides a mechanism to run certain code at times other than
requests, called <code>task</code>s. There are a couple categories, the
simplest one being an initialization task, that is run once when the
application starts up. We use this to initialize our random library.
   </p>
   <pre><code>*)
task initialize = fn () =&gt; Random.init
(*</code></pre>
   <p>
    Part of being a research project is that the standard libraries are
pretty minimal, and one thing that is absent is date handling. You can
format dates, add and subtract, and that’s about it. Since a bit of this
application has to do with tracking what show is the current one, and
whether you’ve already started watching it, I wrote a few functions to
answer the couple date / time questions that I needed. These are all
pure functions, and all the types are inferred.
   </p>
   <pre><code>*)
val date_format = "%Y-%m%d"

fun before_nine t =
    case read (timef "%H" t) of
        None =&gt; error &lt;xml&gt;Could not read Hour&lt;/xml&gt;
      | Some h =&gt; h &lt; 9
    
fun recent_show t =
   let val seconds_day = 24*60*60
       val nt = (if before_nine t then (addSeconds t (-seconds_day)) else t)
       val wd = timef "%u" nt in
   case wd of
       "6" =&gt; addSeconds nt (-seconds_day)
     | "7" =&gt; addSeconds nt (-(2*seconds_day))
     | _ =&gt; nt
   end
(*</code></pre>
   <p>
    The server that I have this application hosted on is in a different
timezone than the show is broadcasted in (EST), so we have to adjust the
current time so that we can tell if it is late enough in the day to get
the current days broadcast. Depending on what timezone your computer is,
this may need to be changed.
   </p>
   <pre><code>*)
fun est_now () =
    n &lt;- now;
    return (addSeconds n (-(4*60*60)))

(*</code></pre>
   <p>
    We track users by tokens - these are short random strings generated
with our random library. The mechanism for syncing devices is to visit
the url (with the token) on every device, so the tokens will need to be
typed in. For that reason, I didn’t want to make the tokens very long,
which means that collisions are a real possibility. To deal with this, I
set the length to be 6 characters, plus the number of tokens, log_26
(since users are encoded with lower case letters, n users can be encoded
with log_26 characters, so we use this as a baseline, and add several so
that the collision probability is low).
   </p>
   <p>
    In this, we see how SQL queries work. You can embed SQL (a subset of
SQL, defined in the manual), and this is translated into a query
datatype, and there are many functions in the standard library to run
those queries. We see here two: <code>oneRowE1</code>, which expects to
get back just one row, and will extract 1 value from it. <code>E</code>
means that it computes a single output expression. Note that it will
error if there is no result, but since we are selecting the count, this
should be fine. <code>hasRows</code> is an even simpler function; it
simply runs the query and returns true iff there are rows.
   </p>
   <p>
    Also note that we refer to the table by name as declared above, and
we refer to columns as record members of the table. To embed regular
Ur/Web values within SQL queries, we use <code>{[value]}</code>. These
queries will not type check if you try to select columns that don’t
exist, and of course does escaping etc.
   </p>
   <pre><code>*)
(* linking to cmath would be better, but since I only
   need an approximation, this is fine *)
fun log26_approx n c : int =
    if c &lt; 26 then n else
    log26_approx (n+1) (c / 26)


(* Handlers for creating and persisting token *)
fun new_token () : transaction string =
    count &lt;- oneRowE1 (SELECT COUNT( * ) FROM u);
    token &lt;- Random.lower_str (6 + (log26_approx 0 count));
    used &lt;- hasRows (SELECT * FROM u WHERE u.Token = {[token]});
    if used then new_token () else return token

(*</code></pre>
   <p>
    We write small functions to set and clear the tokens. We do this so
that after a user has visited the unique player url at least once on
each device, they will only have to remember the application url, not
their unique url. <code>now</code> is a value of type
<code>transaction time</code>, which gives the current time, and
<code>setCookie</code>/<code>clearCookie</code> should be self
explanatory.
   </p>
   <pre><code>*)
fun set_token token =
    t &lt;- now;
    setCookie c {Value = token,

fun clear_token () =
    clearCookie c

   <p>
    The next thing is a bunch of html fragments. Ur/Web doesn’t have a
“templating” system, but it is perfectly possible to create one by
defining functions that take the values to insert in. I’ve opted for a
simpler option, and just defined common pieces. HTML is written in
normal XML format, within <code>&lt;xml&gt;</code> tags, and like the
SQL tags, these are typechecked - having attributes that shouldn’t
exist, nesting tags that don’t belong, or not closing tags all cause the
code not to compile.
   </p>
   <p>
    There are a couple rough edges - some tags are not defined (but you
can define new ones in FFI modules), and some attributes can’t be used
because they are keywords (hence <code>typ</code> instead of
<code>type</code>), but overall it is a neat system, and works very
well.

   <p>
    We now get to the web handlers. These are all url/form entry points,
and do the bulk of the work. The first one, <code>main</code>, which we
rewrote in <code>dn.urp</code> to be the root handler, is mostly HTML -
the only catch being that if you have a cookie set, we just redirect you
to the player.
   </p>
   <p>
    <code>getCookie</code> returns an <code>option CookieType</code>
where <code>CookieType</code> is the type of the cookie (in our case, it
is a string). <code>redirect</code> takes a <code>url</code>, and urls
can be created from handlers (ie, values of type
<code>transaction page</code>) with the <code>url</code> function. So we
apply <code>player</code> which is a handler we’ll define later, to the
token value (as a token is the parameter that <code>player</code>
expects), and grab a url for that.
   </p>
   <p>
    One catch to this is that Ur/Web doesn’t know that
<code>player</code> isn’t going to cause side effects, which would mean
that it shouldn’t have a url created for it (side effecting things
should only be POSTed to), which was why we had to declare
<code>player</code> as <code>safeGet</code> in <code>dn.urp</code>
   </p>
   <p>
    We also see a form that submits to <code>create_player</code>, which
is another handler that we will define. One thing to note is that
<code>create_player</code> is a <code>unit -&gt; transaction page</code>
function - and the action for the submit is just
<code>create_page</code>, not <code>create_page ()</code> - the action
of submitting passes that parameter.

                &lt;/form&gt;
              &lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;Otherwise, visit the url for the player you created (it should look like
                something &lt;code&gt;http://.../player/hcegaoe&lt;/code&gt;) on this device
                to synchronize your devices. You only need to do this once per device, after that
                just visit the home page and we'll load your player.
              &lt;/li&gt;

    <code>create_player</code> is pretty straightforward, but it shows a
different part of Ur/Web’s SQL support: dml supports INSERT, UPDATE, and
DELETE, in the normal ways, with the same embedding as SQL queries (that
<code>{[value]}</code> puts a normal Ur/Web value into SQL). We create a
token, create a “user”, setting that they are on the current day’s show
and at the beginning of it (offset 0.0), store the token, and then
redirect to the player.

   <p>
    The next two functions encompass most of the player, which is the
core of the application. The way that it is structured is a little odd,
but with justification: Chrome on Android caches extremely aggressively,
and doesn’t seem to pay attention to headers that say not to, which
means that if you visited the application, and then a few days later
open up Chrome again, it will seem like it is loading the page, but it
is loading the cached HTML, it is not getting it from the server. This
is really bad for us, because it means it will have both an old offset
(in case you watched some of the show from another device), but worse,
on subsequent days it will be trying to play the wrong day’s show! You
can manually reload the page, but this is silly, so what we do is
initially just load a blank page, and then immediately make a remote
call to actually load the page. So what is cached is a little bit of
HTML and some javascript that loads the page for real.
   </p>
   <p>
    We do all of this is functional reactive style: we declare a
<code>source</code>, which is a place where values will be put, and it
will cause parts of the page (that are <code>signal</code>ed) to update
their values. Then we set an onload handler for the body, which, first,
makes an <code>rpc</code> call to a server side function (which is just
another function, like all of these handlers), and then set the
<code>source</code> that we defined to be the result of rendering the
player. <code>render</code> is a client-side function that just creates
the appropriate forms / html.
   </p>
   <p>
    Finally, we will call a client-side function init, which will do some
setup and then call into the javascipt ffi to the ffi <code>init</code>
function, which will handle the HTML5 audio/video APIs (which Ur/Web
doesn’t support, and are very browser specific anyway).
   </p>
   <p>
    One incredibly special thing that is going on is the
<code>SourceL.set os</code> that is passed to javascript. If you
remember from our <code>.urp</code> file, we imported sourceL. It is a
special reactive construct that allows you to set up handlers that cause
side effects (are transactions) when the value inside the
<code>SourceL</code> changes. So what is happening is we have created
one of these on the server, in <code>player_remote</code>, and sent it
back to the client. The client then curries the <code>set</code>
function with that source, producing a single argument function that
just takes the value to be updated. We hand this function to javascript,
so that in our FFI code, we can just set values into this, and it can
reactively cause stuff to happen in our server-side code.
   </p>
   <p>
    The reactive component on the page is the <code>&lt;dyn&gt;</code>
tag, which is a special construct that allows side-effect free
operations on sources. <code>signal s</code> grabs the current value
from the source <code>s</code>, and in this case we just return this,
but we could do various things to it. The result of the block is what
the value of the <code>&lt;dyn&gt;</code> tag is. In this case, we have
just made a place where we can stick HTML, by calling
<code>set s some_html</code>.
   </p>
   <pre><code>*)
and player token =
    s &lt;- source &lt;xml/&gt;;
    return &lt;xml&gt;
      &lt;head&gt;
        {heading ()}
      &lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;body onload={v &lt;- rpc (player_remote token);
                    set s (render token v.Player v.Show);
                    init token v.Player v.Source (SourceL.set v.Source) v.Video v.Audio}&gt;

      &lt;/xml&gt;
(*</code></pre>
   <p>
    The remote component is where most of the logic of the player
resides. By now, you should be able to read most of what’s going in.
Some points to highlight are the place where we create the
<code>SourceL</code> that we will pass back, and set its initial value
to offset. Also, <code>fresh</code> is a way of generating identifiers
to use within html. Our render function will use this identifier for the
player, which is necessary for the javascript FFI to know where it is.
Finally, <code>bless</code> is a function that will turn strings into
urls, by checking against the policy outlined in the <code>.urp</code>
file for the application.

    The next three functions are simple - the first just renders the
actual player. Note that we use the <code>player_id</code> we generated
in <code>player_remote</code>. Then we provide a way to forget the
player (if you want to unlink two devices, forget the player on one and
create a new one), and due to some imperfections with how we keep the
time in sync (mostly based on weirdness of different browsers
implementations of the HTML5 video/audio APIs), to seek backwards, or
start the show over, we need to tell the server explicitly, so we
provide a handler to do that.

   <p>
    Now we get to the last web handlers. The first one is a client side
initializer. The main thing it sets up is a handler to <code>rpc</code>
to the server whenever the offset <code>SourceL</code> changes. The call
is to <code>update</code> (which we’ll define in a moment), and it
optionally returns a new time to set the client to.
   </p>
   <p>
    This may sound a little odd, but the basic situation is that you play
part of the way through the show on one device, then pause, watch some
on another device, and now hit play on the first device. It will POST a
new time, but the server will tell it that it should actually be at a
later time, and so we use the javascript FFI function
<code>set_offset</code> to set the offset.
   </p>
   <p>
    Finally we make it so that the client silently fails if the
connection fails (this is bad behavior, but simple), and call the
javascript FFI initialization function, which will set up the player and
any HTML5 API related stuff.
   </p>
   <pre><code>*)
and init token player_id os set_offset video_url audio_url =
    SourceL.onChange os (fn offset =&gt; newt &lt;- rpc (update token offset);

    The last function is the simple handler that we called when the
offset <code>SourceL</code> changes. It updates the time if the time is
greater than the recorded offset (this is why we need the
<code>start_over</code> handler), and otherwise returns the recorded
offset to be updated.

    Since this is a adventure in Ur/Web, not Javascript, and there are
plenty of places to learn about the quirks and features of HTML5 media
APIs (and I don’t claim to be an expert), I’m just going to paste the
code in without detailed commentary. The only points that are worth
looking at are how we use <code>setter</code>, which you will remember
is a curried function that will be updating a <code>SourceL</code>,
causing rpcs to update the time. To call functions from the FFI, you use
<code>execF</code>, and to force a transaction to actually occur, you
have to apply the function (to anything), so we end up with double
applications.
   </p>
   <p>
    Other than that, all that is here is some browser detection (as
different browsers have different media behavior) and preferences about
media type in localstorage.
