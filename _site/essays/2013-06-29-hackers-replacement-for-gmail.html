        <h2>A Hacker's Replacement for GMail</h2>

<p>by <em>Daniel Patterson</em> on <strong>June 29, 2013</strong></p>

<p><em>Note: Since writing this I’ve replaced Exim with Postfix and Courier with Dovecot. This is outlined in the Addendum, but the main text is unchanged. Please read the whole guide before starting, as you can skip some of the steps and go straight to the final system.</em></p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>I reluctantly switched to GMail about six months ago, after using many so-called “replacements for GMail” (the last of which was Fastmail). All of them were missing one or more features that I require of email:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Access to the same email on multiple machines (but, these can all be machines I control).</li>
<li>Access to important email on my phone (Android). Sophisticated access not important - just a high-tech pager.</li>
<li>Ability to organize messages by threads.</li>
<li>Ability to categorize messages by tags (folders are <em>not</em> sufficient).</li>
<li>Good search functionality.</li>
</ol>
<p>But, while GMail has all of these things, there were nagging reasons why I still wanted an alternative: handing an advertising company most of my personal and professional correspondance seems like a bad idea, having no (meaningful) way to either sign or encrypt email is unfortunate, and while it isn’t a true deal-breaker, having lightweight programmatic access to my email is a really nice thing (you can get a really rough approximation of this with the RSS feeds GMail provides). Furthermore, I’d be happy if I only get important email on my phone (ie, I want a whitelist on the phone - unexpected email is not something that I need to respond to all the time, and this allows me to elevate the notification for these messages, as they truly are important).</p>
<p>Over the past several months, I gradually put together a mail system that provides all the required features, as well as the three bonuses (encryption, easy programmatic access, and phone whitelisting). I’m describing it as a “Hacker’s Replacement for GMail” as opposed to just a “Replacement for GMail” because it involves a good deal of familiarity with Unix (or at least, to set up and debug the whole system it did. Perhaps following along is easier). But, the end result is powerful enough that for me, it is worth it. I finally switched over to using it primarily recently, confirming that all works as expected. I wanted to share the instructions in case they prove useful to someone else setting up a similar system.</p>
<p>This is somewhere between an outline and a HOWTO. I’ve organized it roughly in order of how I set things up, but some of the parts are more sketches than detailed instructions - supplement it with normal documentation. Most are based on notes from things as I did them, only a few parts were reconstructed. In general, I try to highlight the parts that were difficult / undocumented, and gloss over stuff that should be easy (and/or point to detailed docs). Without further ado:</p>
<h2 id="overall-design">Overall Design</h2>
<ul>
<li>Debian GNU/Linux as mail server operating system (both Linux and Mac as clients, though Windows should be doable)</li>
<li>Exim4 as the mail server</li>
<li>Courier-IMAP for mobile usage</li>
<li>Spamassassin (with Pyzor) for spam</li>
<li><a href="http://notmuchmail.org/">notmuch</a> to manage the email database+tags+search</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/teythoon/afew">afew</a> for managing notmuch tagging/email moving</li>
<li>Emacs client for notmuch on all computers</li>
<li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fsck.k9">K9-Mail</a> on android (my phone)</li>
</ul>
<p>Mail is received by the mail server and put in a Archive subdirectory which is <em>not</em> configured for push in K9-Mail. The mail is processed and tagged by afew, and any messages with the tag “important” are moved into the Important subdirectory. This directory is set up for push in K9-Mail, so I get all important email right away. No further tagging can be done through the mobile device, but that wasn’t a requirement. read/unread status will be synced two-way to notmuch, which <em>is</em> important.</p>
<h2 id="step-by-step-instructions">Step By Step Instructions</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The first and most important part is having a server. I’ve been really happy with VPSes I have from <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=93aab578a407">Digital Ocean</a> (warning: that’s a referral link. <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com">Here’s one without.</a>) - they provide big-enough VPSes for email and a simple website for $5/month. There are also many other providers. The important thing is to get a server, if you don’t already have one.</p></li>
<li><p>The next thing you’ll need is a domain name. You can use a subdomain of one you already have, but the simplest thing is to just get a new one. This is $10-15/year. Once you have it, you want to set a few records (these are set in the “Zone File”, and should be easy to set up through the online control panel of whatever registrar you used):</p></li>
</ol>
<pre><code>A mydomain.com. IP.ADDR.OF.SERVER (mydomain.com. might be written @)
MX 10 mydomain.com.</code></pre>
<p>This sets the domain to point to your server, and sets the mail record to point to that domain name. You will also need to set up a PTR record, or reverse DNS. If you got the server through Digital Ocean, you can set up the DNS records through them, and they allow you to set the PTR record for each server easily. Whereever you set it up, it should point at mydomain.com. (Note trailing period. Otherwise it will resolve to mydomain.com.mydomain.com - not what you want!).</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Now set up the mail server itself. I use Debian, but it shouldn’t be terribly different with other distributions (but you should follow their instructions, not the ones I link to here, because I’m sure there are specifics that are dependent on how Debian sets things up). Since Debian uses Exim4 by default, I used that, and set up Courier as an IMAP server. I followed these instructions: <a href="http://blog.edseek.com/~jasonb/articles/exim4_courier/">blog.edseek.com/~jasonb/articles/exim4_courier/</a> (sections 2, 3, and 4). The only important thing I had to change was to force the hostname, by finding the line it <code>/etc/exim4/exim4.conf.template</code> that looks like:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>.ifdef MAIN_HARDCODE_PRIMARY_HOSTNAME</code></pre>
<p>And adding above it, <code>MAIN_HARDCODE_PRIMARY_HOSTNAME = mydomain.com</code> (no trailing period). This is so that the header that the mail server displays matches the domain. If this isn’t the case, some mail servers won’t deliver messages. At this point, you can test the mail server by sending yourself emails, using the <code>swaks</code> tool, or running it through an online testing tool like <a href="http://mxtoolbox.com/">MX Toolbox</a></p>
<p>The last important thing is to set up spam filtering. When using a big email provider that spends a lot of effort filtering spam (and has huge data sets to do it), it’s easy to forget how much spam is actually sent. But, fortunately open source software is also capable of eliminating it. To set Spamassassin up, I generally followed the documentation on <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/Exim#Spam_scanning">the debian wiki</a>. I changed the last part of the configuration so that instead of changing the subject for spam messages to have “<code>***SPAM***</code>”, it adds the following header:</p>
<pre><code>add_header = X-Spam-Flag: YES</code></pre>
<p>This is the header that the default spam filter from <code>afew</code> will look for and tag messages as spam with. Once messages are tagged as spam, they won’t show up in searches, won’t ever end up in your inbox, etc. On the other hand, they aren’t ever deleted, so if something does end up there, you can always find it (you just have to use notmuch search with the <code>--exclude=false</code> parameter).</p>
<p>That sets up basic Spamassassin, which works quite well. To make it work even better, we’ll install <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/UsingPyzor">Pyzor</a>, which is a service for collaborative spam filtering (sort of an open source system that gets you similar behavior to what GMail can do by having access to so many people’s email). It works by constructing a digest of the message and hashing it, and then sending that hash to a server to see if anyone has marked it as spam.</p>
<p>Install pyzor with <code>aptitude install pyzor</code>, then run <code>pyzor discover</code> (as root), and at least on my system, I needed to run <code>chmod a+r /etc/mail/spamassassin/servers</code> (as root) in order to have it work (the following test command would report permission denied on that file if I didn’t). Now restart spamassassin (<code>/etc/init.d/spamassassin restart</code>) and test that it’s working, by running:</p>
<pre><code>echo &quot;test&quot; | spamassassin -D pyzor 2&gt;&amp;1 | less</code></pre>
<p>This should print (among other things):</p>
<pre><code>Jun 29 16:31:53.026 [24982] dbg: pyzor: network tests on, attempting Pyzor
Jun 29 16:31:54.640 [24982] dbg: pyzor: pyzor is available: /usr/bin/pyzor
Jun 29 16:31:54.641 [24982] dbg: pyzor: opening pipe: /usr/bin/pyzor --homedir ...
Jun 29 16:31:54.674 [24982] dbg: pyzor: [25043] finished: exit 1
Jun 29 16:31:54.674 [24982] dbg: pyzor: check failed: no response</code></pre>
<p>According to <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/UsingPyzor">the documentation</a>, this is expected, because “test” is not a valid message.</p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Now we want to set up our delivery. Create a <code>.forward</code> file in the home directory of the account on the server that is going to recieve mail. It should contain</li>
</ol>
<pre><code># Exim filter

save Maildir/.Archive/</code></pre>
<p>What this does is put all mail that is recieved into the Archive subdirectory (the dots are convention of the version of the Maildir format that Courier-IMAP uses).</p>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Next, we want to set up notmuch. You can install it and the python bindings (needed by afew) with:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>aptitude install notmuch python-notmuch</code></pre>
<ol start="6" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Run <code>notmuch setup</code> and put in your name, email, and make sure that the directory to your email archive is “/home/YOURUSER/Maildir”. Run <code>notmuch new</code> to have it create the directories and, if you tested the mail server by sending yourself messages, import those initial messages.</p></li>
<li><p>Install afew from <a href="https://github.com/teythoon/afew">github.com/teythoon/afew</a>. You can start with the default configuration, and then add filters that will add the tag ‘important’, as well as any other automatic tagging you want to have. I commented out the ClassifyingFilter because it wasn’t working - and I wasn’t convinced I wanted it, so didn’t bother to figure out how te get it to work.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Some simple filters look like:</p>
<pre><code>[Filter.0]
message = messages from someone
query = from:someone.important@email.com
tags = +important
[Filter.1]
message = messages I don't care about
query = subject:Deal
tags = -unread +deals</code></pre>
<p>For the <code>[MailMover]</code> section, you want the configuration to look like:</p>
<pre><code>[MailMover]
folders = Archive Important
max_age = 15

# rules
Archive = 'tag:important AND NOT tag:spam':.Important
Important = 'NOT tag:important':.Archive 'tag:spam':.Archive</code></pre>
<p>This says to take anything in Archive with the important tag and put it in important (but never spam). Note that the folders we are moving to are prefixed with a dot, but the names of the folders aren’t. Now we need to set everything up to run automatically.</p>
<ol start="8" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>We are going to use inotify, and specifically the tool <code>incron</code>, to watch for changes in our .Archive inbox and add files to the database, tag them, and move those that should be moved to .Important. On Debian, you can obtain <code>incron</code> with:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>aptitude install incron</code></pre>
<p>Now edit your incrontab (similar to crontab) with <code>incrontab -e</code> and put an entry like:</p>
<pre><code>/home/MYUSER/Maildir/.Archive/new IN_MOVED_TO,IN_NO_LOOP /home/MYUSER/bin/my-notmuch-new.sh</code></pre>
<p>This says that we want to watch for <code>IN_MOVED_TO</code> events, we don’t want to listen while the script is running (if something goes wrong with your importing script, you could cause an infinite spawning of processes, which will take down the server). If a message is delivered while the script is running, it might not get picked up until the next run, but for me that was fine (you may want to eliminate the <code>IN_NO_LOOP</code> option and see if it actually causes loops. In previous configurations, I crashed my server twice through process spawning loops, and didn’t want to do it again while debugging). When <code>IN_MOVED_TO</code> occurs, we call a script we’ve written. You can obviously put this anywhere, just make it executable:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
/usr/local/bin/notmuch new &gt;&gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
/usr/local/bin/afew -nt &gt;&gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
/usr/local/bin/afew -m &gt;&gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1</code></pre>
<p>It is intentionally being very quiet because output from cron jobs will trigger emails… and thus if there were a mistake, we could be in infinite loop land again. This means you should make sure the commands are working (ie, there aren’t mistakes in your config files), because you won’t see any debug output from them when they are run through this script.</p>
<ol start="8" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Now let’s set up the mobile client. I’m not sure of a good way to do this on iOS (aside from just manually checking the Important folder), but perhaps a motivated person could figure it out. Since I have an Android phone, it wasn’t an issue. On Android, install K9-Mail, and set up your account with the incoming / outgoing mail server to be just ‘mydomain.com’. Click on the account, and it will show just Inbox (not helpful). Hit the menu button, then click folders, and check “display all folders”. Now hit the menu again and click folders and hit “refresh folders”.</li>
</ol>
<p>Provided at least one message has been put into Important and Archive, those should both show up now. Open the folder ‘Important’ and use the settings to enable push for it. Also add it to the Unified Inbox. Similarly, disable push on the Inbox (this latter doesn’t really matter, because we never deliver messages to the inbox). If you have trouble finding these settings (which I did for a while), note that the settings that are available are contingent upon the screen you are on. The folders settings only exist when you are looking at the list of folders (not the unified inbox / list of accounts, and not the contents of a folder).</p>
<ol start="9" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Finally, the desktop client. I’m using the emacs client, because I spend most of my time inside emacs, but there are several other clients - one for vim, one called ‘bower’ that is curses based (that I’ve used before, but is less featureful than the emacs one), and a few others. <code>alot</code>, a python client, won’t work, because it assumes that the notmuch database is local (which is a really stupid assumption). The rest just assume that <code>notmuch</code> is in the path. This means that you can follow the instructions here: <a href="http://notmuchmail.org/remoteusage/">notmuchmail.org/remoteusage</a> to have the desktop use the mail database on the server. To test, run <code>notmuch count</code> on your local machine, and it should return the same thing (the total number of messages) as it does on the mail server.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once this is working, install notmuch locally, so that you get the emacs bindings (or, just download the source and put the contents of the emacs folder somewhere and include it in your .emacs). You should now be able to run <code>M-x notmuch</code> in emacs and get to your inbox. Setting up mail sending is a little trickier - most of the documentation I found didn’t work!</p>
<p>The first thing to do, in case your ISP is like mine and blocks port 25, is to change the default listening port for the server. Open up <code>/etc/default/exim4</code> and set <code>SMTPLISTENEROPTIONS</code> equal to <code>-oX 25:587 -oP /var/run/exim4/exim.pid</code>. This will have it listen on both 25 and 587.</p>
<p>Next, set up emacs to use your mail server to send mail, and to load notmuch. This incantation in your <code>.emacs</code> should do the trick:</p>
<pre><code>;; If you opted to just stick the elisp files somewhere, add that path here:
;; (add-to-list 'load-path &quot;~/path/folder/with/emacs-notmuch&quot;)
(require 'notmuch)
(setq smtpmail-starttls-credentials '((&quot;mydomain.com&quot; 587 nil nil))
      smtpmail-auth-credentials (expand-file-name &quot;~/.authinfo&quot;)
      smtpmail-default-smtp-server &quot;mydomain.com&quot;
      smtpmail-smtp-server &quot;mydomain.com&quot;
      smtpmail-smtp-service 587)
(require 'smtpmail)
(setq message-send-mail-function 'smtpmail-send-it)
(require 'starttls)</code></pre>
<p>Now eval your .emacs (or restart emacs), and you are almost ready to send mail.</p>
<p>You just need to put a line like this into <code>~/.authinfo</code>:</p>
<pre><code>machine mydomain.com login MYUSERNAME password MYPASSWORD port 587</code></pre>
<p>With appropriate permissions (<code>chmod 600 ~/.authinfo</code>).</p>
<p>Now you can test this by typing <code>C-x m</code> or <code>M-x notmuch</code> and then from there, hit the ‘m’ key - both of these open the composition window. Type a message and who it is to, and then type <code>C-c C-c</code> to send it. It should take a second and then say it was sent at the bottom of the window.</p>
<p>This should work as-is on Linux. Another machine I sometimes use is a mac, and things are a little more complicated. The main problem is that to send mail, we need starttls. You can install <code>gnutls</code> through Homebrew, Fink, or Macports, but the next problem is that if you are using Emacs installed from emacsformacosx.com (and thus it is a graphical application), it is not started from a shell, which means it doesn’t have the same path, and thus doesn’t know how to find gnutls. To fix this problem (which is more general), you can install a tiny Emacs package called <code>exec-path-from-shell</code> (this requires Emacs 24, which you should use - then <code>M-x package-install</code>) that interrogates a shell about what the path should be. Then, we just have to tell it to use <code>gnutls</code> and all should work. We can do this all in a platform specific way (so it won’t run on other platforms):</p>
<pre><code>(when (memq window-system '(mac ns))
  (exec-path-from-shell-initialize)
  (setq starttls-use-gnutls t)
  (setq starttls-gnutls-program &quot;gnutls-cli&quot;)
  (setq starttls-extra-arguments nil)
  )</code></pre>
<ol start="10" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Address lookup. It’s really nice to have an address book based on messages in your mailbox. An easy way to do this is to install addrlookup: get the source from <code>http://github.com/spaetz/vala-notmuch/raw/static-sources/src/addrlookup.c</code>, build with</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>cc -o addrlookup addrlookup.c `pkg-config --cflags --libs gobject-2.0` -lnotmuch</code></pre>
<p>and move the resulting binary into your path (all of this on your server), and then create a similar wrapper as for notmuch:</p>
<pre><code>~/bin/addrlookup:

#!/bin/bash
printf -v ARGS &quot;%q &quot; &quot;$@&quot;
exec ssh your_server addrlookup ${ARGS}</code></pre>
<p>And then add this to your <code>.emacs</code>:</p>
<pre><code>(require 'notmuch-address)
(setq notmuch-address-command &quot;/path/to/addrlookup&quot;)
(notmuch-address-message-insinuate)</code></pre>
<p>Now if you hit “TAB” after you start typing in an address, it will prompt you with completions (use up/down arrow to move between, hit enter to select).</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Congratulations! You now have a mail system that is more powerful than GMail and completely controlled by you. And there is a lot more you can do. For example, to enable encryption (to start, just signing emails), install <code>gnupg</code>, create a key and associate it with your email address, and add the following line to your .emacs and all messages will be signed by default (it adds a line in the message that when you send it causes emacs to sign the email. Note that this line must be the first line, so add your message <em>below</em> it):</p>
<pre><code>(add-hook 'message-setup-hook 'mml-secure-message-sign-pgpmime)</code></pre>
<p>An unfortunate current limitation is that the keys are checked by the notmuch commandline, so you need to install public keys on the server. This is fine, except that the emacs client installs them locally when you click on an unknown key (hit $ when viewing a message to see the signatures). So, at least for now, you have to manually add keys to the server with <code>gpg --recv-key KEYID</code> before they will show up as verified on the client (signing/encrypting still works, because that is done locally). Hopefully this will be fixed soon.</p>

<h2 id="addendum">Addendum</h2>
<p>Among the large amount of feedback I received on this post, many people recommended that I use Postfix and Dovecot over Exim and Courier. Postfix chosen because of security (Exim has a less than stellar history), and dovecot because it is simpler and faster than Courier (and more importantly, combined with Postfix frequently). Security is really important to me (as I want this system to be easy to mantain), so I decided to switch it. Since I’m not doing anything particularly complicated with the mail server / IMAP, the conversion was relatively straightforward. For people reading this, I’d suggest just doing this from the start (and substitute for the parts setting up Exim / Courier), but if you’ve already followed the instructions (as I have), here is what you should do to change. Note that I have gotten much of this information from guides at <a href="https://syslog.tv/">syslog.tv</a>, modified as needed.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Install postfix and dovecot with (accept the replacement policy):</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get install dovecot-imapd postfix sasl2-bin libsasl2-2 libsasl2-modules procmail</code></pre>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Add this to end of <code>/etc/postfix/main.cf</code>, to tell Postfix to use Maildir, sasl,</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>    home_mailbox = Maildir/

    smtpd_sasl_type = dovecot
    smtpd_sasl_path = private/auth
    smtpd_sasl_auth_enable = yes
    smtpd_sasl_security_options = noanonymous
    smtpd_sasl_local_domain = $myhostname
    broken_sasl_auth_clients = yes

    smtpd_sender_restrictions = permit_sasl_authenticated,
    permit_mynetworks,

    smtpd_recipient_restrictions = permit_mynetworks,
    permit_sasl_authenticated,
    reject_unauth_destination,
    reject_unknown_sender_domain,</code></pre>
<p>Add this to the end of /etc/postfix/master.cf:</p>
<pre><code>spamassassin unix - n n - - pipe
  user=spamd argv=/usr/bin/spamc -f -e
  /usr/sbin/sendmail -oi -f ${sender} ${recipient}</code></pre>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: It’s been pointed out to me that you may not have a <code>spamd</code> user on your system, this won’t work. So check that, and add the user if it’s missing.</p>
<p>And this at the beginning, right after the line <code>smpt inet n ...</code></p>
<pre><code>   -o content_filter=spamassassin</code></pre>
<p>And uncomment the line starting with ‘submission’ and put the following after it:</p>
<pre><code>  -o syslog_name=postfix/submission
  -o smtpd_tls_security_level=encrypt
  -o smtpd_sasl_auth_enable=yes
  -o smtpd_sasl_type=dovecot
  -o smtpd_sasl_path=private/auth
  -o smtpd_client_restrictions=permit_sasl_authenticated,reject
  -o smtpd_recipient_restrictions=reject_non_fqdn_recipient,
     reject_unknown_recipient_domain,permit_sasl_authenticated,reject</code></pre>
<p>3. Change myhostname to be fully qualified if it isn’t. Confirm all is well with http://mxtoolbox.com</p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Set up dovecot. Edit /etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-mail.conf and change mail_location to:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>maildir:~/Maildir/</code></pre>
<p>Edit /etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-master.conf and inside <code>service auth</code> comment the block that is there, and uncomment the one that is:</p>
<pre><code>  unix_listener /var/spool/postfix/private/auth {
    mode = 0666
  }</code></pre>
<p>Edit /etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-auth.conf and uncomment the line at the top:</p>
<pre><code>disable_plaintext_auth = yes</code></pre>
<p>Now to test that this is working, use <code>swaks</code> from a remote host, and run a command like:</p>
<pre><code>swaks -a -tls -q HELO -s mydomain.com -au myuser -ap &quot;mypassword&quot; -p 587</code></pre>
<p>And you should get a good response.</p>

<p>This says to copy the message to the archive and then run my-notmuch-new.sh (which is a shell script that used to be called by incron). Technically it pipes the message to the script, but the script ignores standard in, so it is equivalent to just calling the script. Now fix the ownership:</p>
