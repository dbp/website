        <h2>(Cheap) home backups</h2>

<p>by <em>Daniel Patterson</em> on <strong>January  1, 2018</strong></p>

<p>Backing things up is important. Some stuff, like code that lives in repositories, may naturally end up in many places, so it perhaps is less important to explicitly back up. Other files, like photos, or personal documents, generally don’t have a natural redundant home, so they need some backup story, and relying on various online services is risky (what if they go out of business, “pivot”, etc), potentially time-consuming to keep track of (services for photos may not allow videos, or at least not full resolution ones, etc), limited in various ways (max file sizes, storage allotments, etc), not to mention bringing up serious privacy concerns. Different people need different things, but what I need, and have built (hence this post describing the system), fulfills the following requirements:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>(Home) scalable – i.e., any reasonable amount of data that I could generate personally I should be able to dump in one place, and be confident that it won’t go away. What makes up the bulk is photos, some music, and some audio and video files. For me, this is currently about 1TB (+-0.5TB).</li>
<li>Cheap. I’m willing to pay about $100-200/year total (including hardware).</li>
<li>Simple. There has to be <em>one</em> place where I can dump files, it has to be simple enough to recover from complete failure of any given piece of hardware even if I haven’t touched it in a long time (because if it is working, I won’t have had to tweak it in months / years). Adding &amp; organizing files should be doable without commandline familiarity, so it can serve my whole home.</li>
<li>Safe. Anything that’s not in my physical control should be encrypted.</li>
<li>Reasonably reliable. Redundancy across hardware, geographic locations, etc. This is obviously balanced with other concerns (in particular, 2 and 3)!</li>
</ol>
<p>I’ve tried various solutions, but what I’ve ended up with seems to be working pretty well (most of it has been running for about a year; some parts are more recent, and a few have been running for much longer). It’s a combination of some cheap hardware, inexpensive cloud storage, and decent backup software.</p>
<h3 id="why-not-an-off-the-shelf-nas">Why not an off-the-shelf NAS?</h3>
<p>In the past, I tried one (it was a Buffalo model). I wasn’t impressed by the software (which was hard to upgrade, install other stuff on it, maintain, etc), the power consumption (this was several years ago, but <em>idle</em> the two-drive system used over 30watts, which is the same power that my similarly aged quad core workstation uses when idle!). Also, a critical element of this system for me is that there is an off-site component, so getting that software on it is extremely important, and I’d rather have a well-supported linux computer to deal with rather than something esoteric. Obviously this depends in the particular NAS you get, but the system below is perfect <em>for me</em>. In particular, setting up and experimenting with the below was much cheaper than dropping hundreds more dollars on a new NAS that may not have worked any better than the old one, and once I had it working, there was certainly no point in going back!</p>
<h3 id="hardware">Hardware</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>$70 - Raspberry Pi 3. This consumes very little power (a little over 1W without the disks, probably around 10W with them spinning, more like 3W when they are idling), takes up very little space, but seems plenty fast enough to act as a file server. That price includes a case, heat-sink, SD card, power adaptor, etc. If you had any of these things, you can probably get a cheaper kit (the single board itself is around $35). Note that you <em>really</em> want a heat-sink on the processor. I ran without it for a while (forgot to install it) and it would overheat and hard lock. It’s a tradeoff that they put a much faster processor in these than in prior generations – I think it’s worth it (it’s an amazingly capably computer for the size/price).</p></li>
<li><p>$75 - Three external USB SATA hard drive enclosures. You might be able to find these cheaper – the ones I got were metal, which seemed good in terms of heat dissipation, and have been running for a little over a year straight without a problem (note: this is actually one more than I’m using at any given time, to make it easier to rotate in new drives; BTRFS, which I’m using, allows you to just physically remove a drive and add a new one, but the preferred method is to have both attached, and issue a <code>replace</code> command. I’m not sure how much this matters, but for $25, I went with the extra enclosure).</p></li>
<li><p>$170 - Two 2TB WD Red SATA drives. These are actually recent upgrades – the server was been running on older 1TB Green drives (four and five years old respectively), but one of them started reporting failures (I would speculate the older of the two, but I didn’t check) so I replaced both. The cheaper blue drives probably would have been fine (the Greens that the Blues have replaced certainly have lasted well enough, running nearly 24/7 for years), but the “intended to run 24/7” Red ones were only $20 more each so I thought I might as well spring for them.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cloud">Cloud</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html">Backblaze B2</a>. This seems to be the cheapest storage that scales down to storing nothing. At my usage (0.5-2TB) it costs about $3-10/month, which is a good amount, and given that it is one of three copies (the other two being on the two hard drives I have attached to the Pi) I’m not worried about the missing reliability vs for example Amazon S3 (B2 gives 8 9s of durability vs S3 at 11 9s, but to get that S3 charges you 3-4x as much).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="software">Software</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The Raspberry Pi is running Raspbian (Debian distributed for the Raspberry Pi). This seems to be the best supported Linux distribution, and I’ve used Debian on servers &amp; desktops for maybe 10 years now, so it’s a no-brainer. The external hard drives are a RAID1 with BTRFS. If I were doing it from scratch, I would look into ZFS, but I’ve been migrating this same data over different drives and home servers (on the same file system) since ZFS was essentially totally experimental on Linux, and on Linux, for RAID1, BTRFS seems totally stable (people do not say the same thing about RAID5/6).</p>
<p>The point is, you should use an advanced file system in RAID1 (on ZFS you could go higher, but I prefer simplicity and the power consumption of having just two drives, and can afford to pay for the wasted drive space) that can detect&amp;correct errors, lets you swap in new drives and migrate out old ones, migrate to larger drives, etc. This is essentially the feature-set that both ZFS and BTRFS have, but the former is considered to be more stable and the latter has been in linux for longer.</p></li>
<li><p>For backups, I’m using <a href="https://github.com/gilbertchen/duplicacy">Duplicacy</a>, which is annoyingly similarly named to a much older backup tool called <a href="http://duplicity.nongnu.org/">Duplicity</a> (there also seems to be another tool called <a href="https://github.com/duplicati/duplicati">Duplicati</a>, which I haven’t tried. Couldn’t backup tools get more creative with names? How about calling a tool “albatross”?). It’s also annoyingly <em>not</em> free software, but for personal use, the command-line version (which is the only version that I would be using) <em>is</em> free-as-in-beer. I actually settled on this after trying and failing to use (actually open-source) competitors:</p>
<p>First, I tried the aforementioned <a href="http://duplicity.nongnu.org/">Duplicity</a> (using its friendly frontend <a href="http://duply.net/">duply</a>). I actually was able to make some full backups (the full size of the archive was around 600GB), but then it started erroring out because it would out-of-memory when trying to unpack the file lists. The backup format of Duplicity is not super efficient, but it is very simple (which was appealing – just tar files and various indexes with lists of files). Unfortunately, some operations need memory that seems to scale with the size of the currently backed up archive, which is a non-starter for my little server with 1GB of ram (and in general <em>shouldn’t</em> be acceptable for backup software, but…)</p>
<p>I next tried a newer option, <a href="https://github.com/restic/restic">restic</a>. This has a more efficient backup format, but also had the same problem of running out of memory, though it wasn’t even able to make a backup (though that was probably a good thing, as I wasted less time!). They are aware of it (see, e.g., <a href="https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/450">this issue</a>, so maybe at some point it’ll be an option, but that issue is almost two years old so ho hum…).</p>
<p>So finally I went with the bizarrely sort-of-but-not-really open-source option, Duplicacy. I found other people talking about running it on a Raspberry Pi, and it seemed like the primary place where memory consumption could become a problem was the number of threads used to upload, which thankfully is an argument. I settled on 16 and it seems to work fine (i.e., <code>duplicacy backup -stats -threads 16</code>) – the memory consumption seems to hover below 60%, which leaves a very healthy buffer for anything else that’s going on (or periodic little jumps), and regardless, more threads don’t seem to get it to work faster.</p>
<p>The documentation on how to use the command-line version is a little sparse (there is a GUI version that costs money), but once I figured out that to configure it to connect automatically to my B2 account I needed a file <code>.duplicacy/preferences</code> that looked like (see <code>keys</code> section; the rest will probably be written out for you if you run <code>duplicacy</code> first; alternatively, just put this file in place and everything will be set up):</p>
<pre><code>[
  {
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;default&quot;,
      &quot;id&quot;: &quot;SOME-ID&quot;,
      &quot;storage&quot;: &quot;b2://BUCKET_NAME&quot;,
      &quot;encrypted&quot;: true,
      &quot;no_backup&quot;: false,
      &quot;no_restore&quot;: false,
      &quot;no_save_password&quot;: false,
      &quot;keys&quot;: {
          &quot;b2_id&quot;: &quot;ACCOUNT_ID&quot;,
          &quot;b2_key&quot;: &quot;ACCOUNT_KEY&quot;,
          &quot;password&quot;: &quot;ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD&quot;
      }
  }
]</code></pre>
<p>Everything else was pretty much smooth sailing (though, as per usual, the initial backup is quite slow. The Raspberry Pi 3 processor is certainly much faster than previous Raspberry Pis, and fast enough for this purpose, but it definitely still has to work hard! And my residential cable upstream is not all that impressive. After a couple days though, the initial backup will complete!).</p>
<p>Periodic backups run with the same command, and intermediate ones can be pruned away as well (I use <code>duplicacy prune -keep 30:180 -keep 7:30 -keep   1:1</code>, run after my daily backup, to keep monthly backups beyond 6 months, weekly beyond 1 month, and daily below that. I have a cron job that runs the backup daily, so the last is not strictly necessary, but if I do manual backups it’ll clean them up over time. Since I pretty much never delete files that are put into this archive, pruning isn’t really about saving space, as barring some error on the server the latest backup should contain every file, but it is nice to have the list of snapshots be more manageable).</p>
<p>To restore from total loss of the Pi, you just need to put the config file above into <code>.duplicacy/preferences</code> relative to the current directory on any machine and you can run <code>duplicacy restore</code>. You can also grab individual files (which I tested on a different machine; I haven’t tested restoring a full backup) by creating the above mentioned file and then running <code>duplicacy list -files -r N</code> (where N is the snapshot you want to get the file from; run <code>duplicacy list</code> to find which one you want) and then to get a file <code>duplicacy cat -r N path/to/file &gt; where/to/put/it</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>I’m still working out how to detect errors in the hard drives automatically. I can see them manually by running <code>sudo btrfs device stats /mntpoint</code> (which I do periodically). When this shows that a drive is failing (i.e., read/write errors), add a new drive to the spare enclosure, format it, and then run <code>sudo   btrfs replace start -f N /dev/sdX /mntpoint</code> where N is the number of the device that is failing (when you run <code>sudo btrfs fi show /mntpoint</code>) and <code>/dev/sdX</code> is the new drive. To check for and correct errors in the file system (not the underlying drive), run <code>sudo btrfs scrub start /mntpoint</code>. This will run in the background; if you care you can check the status with <code>sudo btrfs scrub status /mntpoint</code>. Based on recommendations, I have the scrub process run monthly via a cron job.</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to expand the capacity of the disks, replace the drives as if they failed (see previous bullet) and then run <code>sudo btrfs fi resize N:max   /mntpoint</code> for each <code>N</code> (run <code>sudo btrfs fi show</code> to see what your dev ids are). When you replace them, they stay at the same capacity – this resize expands the filesystem to the full device. As I mentioned earlier, I did this to replace 1TB WD Green drives with 2TB WD Red drives (so I replaced one, then the next, then did the resize on both).</p></li>
<li><p>For tech people (i.e., who are comfortable with <code>scp</code>), this setup is enough – just get files onto the server, into the right directory, and it’ll be all set. For less tech-savvy people, you can install samba on the raspberry pi and then set up a share like the following (put this at the bottom of <code>/etc/samba/smb.conf</code>):</p>
<pre><code>[sharename]
comment = Descriptive name
path = /mntpoint
browseable = yes
writeable = yes
read only = no
only guest = no
create mask = 0777
directory mask = 0777
public = yes
guest ok = no</code></pre>
<p>Then set <code>pi</code>s password with <code>sudo smbpasswd -i pi</code>. Now restart the service with <code>sudo /etc/init.d/sambda restart</code> and then from a mac (and probably windows; not sure how as I don’t have any in my house) you can connect to the pi with the “Connect to Server” interface, connect as the <code>pi</code> user with the password you set, and see the share. Note that to be able to make changes, the <code>/mntpoint</code> (and what’s in it) needs to be writeable by the <code>pi</code> user. You can also use a different user, set up samba differently, etc.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>The system described above runs 24/7 in my home. It cost $325 in hardware (which, if you want to skip the extra USB enclosure to start and use WD Blue drives rather than Red ones you can cut $65 – i.e., $260 total), $1/month in electricity (I haven’t measured this carefully, but that’s what 10W costs where I live) and currently costs about $3/month in cloud storage, though that will go up over time, so to be more fair let’s say $5/month. Assuming no hardware replacements for three years (which is the warrantee on the hard drives I have, so a decent estimate), the total cost over that time is $325 + $54 + $170 = $549, or around $180 per year, which is squarely in the range that I wanted.</p>
