    Summary and some notes
   </h3>
   <p>
    There wasn’t much information out there about this build, even though
it seems like a lot of people have made them. In particular, I had no
idea how long I should expect it to take (and I underestimated how long
it would take – the only number I saw was 10 days, which perhaps a
professional, or someone with a helper, could do, but not me!). So this
page is an attempt to give more information that might be useful to
someone taking on this project. In the end, with every step, including a
bunch of time spent stripping off poorly adhered paint and repainting
(probably around 15hrs lost), to a rigged boat ready to launch, it took
<strong>150.75 hours</strong>. As a total amateur.
   </p>
   <p>
    Also, the plans are pretty detailed, but they aren’t perfect – there
are places where they are incomplete, or misleading (e.g., they suggest
gluing in the mast step at two different places in the plans – I chose
the first one arbitrarily! Even worse, the rudder box instructions say,
counter to the pictures, you should glue the framing on <em>after</em>
gluing the box together. But if you do that, it’s impossible to drill a
countersunk hole on the <em>inside</em> of the rudderbox. So the
proposed assembly instructions are essentially impossible) So read
everything and try to understand how things fit together – it’s not a
matter of just following the instructions in order. However, I am
confident that they include enough information that a complete novice
(like me) can end up with a boat, but it probably won’t match what is
describe exactly, because I don’t think what is describe is actually
consistent. Somewhat frustrating, especially given how much love people
give to the plan author (as an engineering spec, at least the type I
would expect from my entirely different background as a software
engineering, I would give it a C-).
   </p>
   <p>
    Another unclear part is when you should be epoxying things! In the
appendix, the author says that they strongly prefer coating surfaces at
the point that they are getting glued to other things, but then the
instructions (and images) don’t seem to do that. Some surfaces really
should be done that way, because then they will become in internal
places, but others may be better to wait (I realize now, perhaps the
inside of sealed compartments need not have been coated at all! Assuming
no leaks, they should never see water, and it would have saved time and
weight to not coat them). I ended up coating most everything (on both
sides) before assembly, somewhat ignoring the advice that places where
pieces will later get attached should get masked off (confusingly, one
of the main sources of information, aside from the plans, is this site:
<a href="http://www.bitingmidge.com/boats/ozracer/building/oneminute.html">http://www.bitingmidge.com/boats/ozracer/building/oneminute.html</a>,
which suggests pre-coating the <em>entire</em> plywood panels. This
might have actually been a much better plan, but clearly contradicts the
idea that you shouldn’t pre-coat areas that will get glued. It’s also
probably somewhat wasteful, as even scrap parts get coated, and it may
make things harder to cut, as epoxy makes the wood a lot stronger). I
then sanded the panels before they got glued to other parts, and
hopefully it’s all strong enough!

   <h3 id="tools-used-in-order-of-frequency">
    Tools Used (in order of
frequency):
   </h3>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Drill
    </li>
    <li>
     Jig Saw
    </li>
    <li>
     Belt Sander
    </li>
    <li>
     Orbital Sander
    </li>
    <li>
     Router
    </li>
    <li>
     Table saw – to rip lumber to the right dimensions (done all at once
the first day, as I didn’t own one when I started this)
    </li>
    <li>
     Hand plane
    </li>
    <li>
     Thickness planer (to get the foil blanks to right thickness)
    </li>
    <li>
     Electric plane
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    Note: I ended up not using the hand plane for any of the initial
steps, even though the plans had you using it all the time. The one I
bought was crappy and the sharpening guide I bought didn’t fit it, so
sharpening was hard. So I used the jig saw / belt sander for most things
(cutting down to close, using sander for the rest), and for narrowing
the mast pieces which I used the router. For making the foils, however,
I ended up using the hand plane for the leading edge. For the trailing
edge, I used an electric hand plane, but to get the curve on the leading
edge, even the not great hand plane worked much better, with a sander
used to clean it up. And then for rounding the yard and shaping the
oars, I used it, crappy as it was (lots of tear-out cleaned up by
sanding), a LOT.

    This was quite a bit more than I was expecting (which, based on
things I had read, made me think it’d be about $500). Part of that is
probably that I got marine paint, which is expensive, vs.&nbsp;regular
outdoor house paint (which probably would have been fine, and probably
would have saved ~$80), but also not thinking about all the disposable
stuff (brushes, rollers, drop cloths, gloves) which, on it’s own isn’t
expensive, but adds up. Finally, the rigging stuff, deck hatches, and
rudder hardware is not cheap ($51 for rope &amp; blocks, $35 for rudder
stuff, $20 for two 6” hatches)! Those things account for about $300,
which combined with probably paying more for lumber than strictly
necessary (I got high quality 5/4ths stuff for the foils, which was not
cheap, and I probably could have just gotten more 2x4s and ripped them.
The plywood was just under $100, and there really wasn’t that much other
lumber necessary) and a lot of miscellaneous things (like $8.65 for seam
tape for the sail, $5 for high quality thread, etc) account for the
“extra”.

    Extra cost

   <p>
    The initial paint job I did both didn’t come out well (I think it was
way too hot when I painted it, especially the top, which I did outside
in the sun!), and I realized that the color on top really didn’t look
right. So I decided to scrape/sand off the paint and repaint it. Since
this was turning into a much longer term project, I decided to spend
more time researching and decided to paint it with old-school marine
paint from the local shop Kirby paints (which has been operating
continuously since 1846). It’s a bit more expensive than the original
stuff I got, but the colors are a lot nicer. Getting a couple quarts,
plus thinner, and some brushes was about another $100.

   <img src="/static/boat/boat-1.jpg"> Getting all the lumber, post
stripping it with a table saw my dad had. Without access to a table saw
and someone who knows how to use it, I don’t think this project would be
possible – the dimensions of lumber needed are <em>not</em> things that
are available standard. And, even if they were, they would probably be
so much more expensive. For example, I got 12” wide pine planks that
were then ripped to get the 3/4” by 3/4” strips, the 3/4” by 1 3/4”,
etc.

mistake is present in this photo – third and possibly fourth clamp are
not in the right place, and the flexible wood batten was so flexible

curve! All other panels marked to match this one, replicating the
mistake.)

and then put in screws to hold it</strong>), attached bottom (involving
a bit of work to get the boat square, and then a lot more work to get
the bottom to attach to the sides due to the mistake shaping the bottom;
had to add more trim and screw through the bottom to get it to pull up
to side panels.)

to a lug sail which requires shorter masts, and thus I can cut off the
mistake!)

single coat of epoxy, so fiberglass tape is still very present. It also
hadn’t fully dried when we took it out the next day, so I wrapped duct
tape around the handle and halfway down the shaft, so it wouldn’t feel
sticky!)

added some thickened epoxy. I’ll have to test the watertightness by
dumping water into the tank and see if any comes out!

    <img src="/static/boat/boat-26.jpg"> Sewing the sail. This took a
long time and a <em>lot</em> of sewing! But the result seemed to come
out pretty well, modulo some mistakes (i.e., the tall reinforcing panel
that runs most of the way through this photo should have gone higher so
the curve at the top hit the top edge of the sail a bit higher than it
did).

    <img src="/static/boat/boat-27.jpg"> Planing foils. This would have
been much easier if my hand plane was better, but I made do by using it
on the leading edge (just for the actual curve, which had very narrow
shavings that it did better on) and the electric hand planer on the
rest, and on the trailing edge. They probably aren’t perfect, but they
look pretty good!
