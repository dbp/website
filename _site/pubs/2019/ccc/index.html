    Compiler correctness is an old problem, with results stretching back
        beyond the last half-century. Founding the field, John McCarthy and James
        Painter set out to build a "completely trustworthy compiler". And yet,
        until quite recently, even despite truly impressive verification efforts,
        the theorems being proved were only about the compilation of whole
        programs, a theoretically quite appealing but practically unrealistic
        simplification. For a compiler correctness theorem to assure complete
        trust, the theorem must reflect the reality of how the compiler will be
        used.
   </p>
   <p>
    There has been much recent work on more realistic "compositional"
        compiler correctness aimed at proving correct compilation of components
        while supporting linking with components compiled from different
        languages using different compilers. However, the variety of theorems,
        stated in remarkably different ways, raises questions about what
        researchers even mean by a "compiler is correct." In this pearl, we
        develop a new framework with which to understand compiler correctness
        theorems in the presence of linking, and apply it to understanding and
        comparing this diversity of results. In doing so, not only are we better
        able to assess their relative strengths and weaknesses, but gain insight
        into what we as a community should expect from compiler correctness
        theorems of the future.
