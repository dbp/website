    Here is a calendar of all the office hours that the course staff offer. If
you would like to speak to an instructor and you cannot make it to their
office hours, send an email to set up a meeting. If you have a general question
and cannot make it to anyone’s office hours, post to Piazza (see below).
   </p>
   <p>
    For the most part, staff members will
have the same office hours every week. Before going to someone’s hours, check where
they will be on the calendar below. Should there be a change to someone’s hours,
there will be a post on Piazza and the calendar will be updated.
   </p>

   <div class="SIntrapara">
    While some office hours will be in person, we will use the
<a href="https://officehours.khoury.northeastern.edu/">Khoury Office Hours tool</a> for other office hours. Take these steps to join office hours:

    Your TAs help run the labs, help grade the assignments and exams, and hold office
hours.  In general, they are apprentice teachers and are here to learn how to
run a course.  At the same time, though, they are your peers who have taken the
course, and can see your problems from your perspective.

   <p>
    The goal of the labs is to see in practice problems that illustrate the concepts covered
in the lectures, and to prepare you for the next programming assignment. Attendance is required.
   </p>
   <p>
    There is a lot of technical detail related to running Java programs that will be covered
in the early labs.  Later labs will focus more on design questions and on good Java programming practice.
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: bold">Lab work</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    Lab attendance is required.
There will be a lab quiz or some lab work to be submitted which will be graded. You are responsible for making
sure your submissions go through and that the correct file(s) are submitted within the alotted time.
No makeups for lab work are allowed, but we will drop your two lowest lab quiz/work grades.
The goal of lab work is to see that you are familiar with the most basic
concepts covered during the recent lectures and prepare you to tackle the assignments.
   </p>
   <p>
    If you have trouble completing lab work, it would be a good idea to meet with the instructor within the next week,
to identify the problems you may have and to help you get back on track.

   <p>
    You will complete your assignments (other than the first
one) using the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse IDE</a>. Though, if you feel more comfortable,
you may choose to use another IDE (e.g. NetBeans) or work
directly from the command line, but you and your partner must both be comfortable with the
chosen programming environment, and the staff may not be able to assist you with issues encountered in other
environments.
   </p>
   <p>
    You will use <a href="https://handins.ccs.neu.edu">the handin server</a> to submit your homework.
You may submit as many times as you wish, though submitting too
frequently may be detected and rate-limited, to ensure fairness for other students.
Be aware that close to the deadline when everyone submits all at once, the server will become slower. Don’t
wait until the last minute to submit!

   </h4>
   <p>
    There will be one or two problem sets each week. The problem sets often include finger exercises and
practice problems, that you are strongly encouraged to look at and confirm that you can solve (but are not required).
You are welcome to bring solutions to these problems to the course staff during the semester for
informal feedback on how you’re doing.
   </p>
   <p>
    The graded problems are to be solved collaboratively with your partner when you are assigned one in
the second half of the term.
The problems will consist of structured programming assignments that may be based on the work done
in previous weeks, and may also include more creative projects where you can practice your design skills.
   </p>
   <p>
    Assignments may not be resubmitted 24 hours after their deadlines have passed. There is a late penalty for
submissions that are submitted within 24 hours of a deadline.
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: bold">Due Dates: <span class="emph">Mondays and Thursdays at 9:00pm,</span></span> unless otherwise specified. See the late policy above.

   <p>
    <span style="color: red"><span style="font-weight: bold">Note:</span></span> You will submit each problem <span class="emph">separately</span> on the handin server.
This is for your benefit: the server
will attempt to compile and run your program against automated test cases. Having separate
submissions for each problem means that a syntax error in one
problem won’t immediately prevent your other problems from compiling also. Be careful to
submit the correct answers to the correct problems. <span style="font-weight: bold">You are responsible for making
sure your submissions go through and that the correct file(s) are submitted.</span>
   </p>

   </h4>
   <p>
    Although the homework problems can be solved individually, you must work on some of the problem sets in pairs in
the second half of the term.
You will get a partner from your lab section and you will work on labs together as well (although lab submissions
are usually individual).
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: bold">Important</span>
Pair programming means that you and your partner work on the problem sets jointly. You read them together and
you work on the solutions together. One of the lab’s purposes is to teach you how to work in pairs effectively;
indeed, pairs are provably more effective than
individuals in programming. The rough idea is this: One of you plays <span class="emph">pilot</span>, the other <span class="emph">co-pilot</span>.
The pilot works on the keyboard and explains aloud what is going on; it is the co-pilot’s responsibility to
question everything. After a problem is solved to the satisfaction of both, you <span class="emph">must</span> switch roles.
   </p>
   <p>
    Every partner must be able to solve every homework problem in the end. It is an <span style="font-weight: bold">academic integrity violation</span>
to submit work under your name
that you have not worked on. Doing so may result in earning a 0 on the work and a report to OSCCR. You may also lose the privelege of
working with a partner. Therefore <span style="font-weight: bold">both</span> partners must make the effort to meet regularly and work together on
every part of the assignments/labs.
   </p>
   <p>
    If you are having difficulties working with your partner, please inform your lab TA or your instructor quickly:
we cannot help if we don’t know there’s a problem. We will check in periodically to assess how the partnerships are going.
   </p>
   <h4 class="heading">

   </h4>
   <p>
    Any and all submitted work must be your own. If an assignment/lab is to be completed individually, only you and
the course staff are allowed to look at your code. If an assignment/lab is to be completed with a partner, only you,
your partner and the course staff are allowed to look at your code (see above as well about working with a partner).
<span style="font-weight: bold">Use of material from previous classes, solution manuals, material from the Internet or other sources (such as AI
assisted tools like ChatGPT or sources such as parents, friends, siblings etc.) that directly bears on the answers
is strictly prohibited.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
    You are allowed to discuss the problem sets with others, so long as you acknowledge (in comments, in your submitted files)
whoever you discussed the problem with. Discussing the "what to solve" is OK, discussing "how to solve" is a slippery slope.
Once you start discussing possible solutions, you may not realize when you have crossed the line. Ultimately we will judge
you by the work you submit. If you think you are smart enough to use somebody’s code and hide it well enough to deceive us,
please channel that intelligence towards completing the assignment yourself! Doing the assignments yourself is essential
for doing well on the exams which tend to be higher stakes than homework.
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: red">NOTE:</span></span> Be aware that while <span class="emph">submitting</span> someone else’s code is clearly a violation, so is <span class="emph">sharing
your code with others</span>, even if you truly just mean to help. You will be doing your friend or peer a disservice by helping
them this way. Please direct them to the course staff instead.
   </p>
   <p>
    Outside an academic environment, sharing code with unauthorized parties can be a criminal offense and have severe and
unanticipated consequences.
   </p>
   <p>
    Submitting code that is not your own or sharing your code to unfairly help another student will be considered a violation
of the University’s Academic Integrity Policy (page 38 of the
<a href="https://acrobat.adobe.com/link/track?uri=urn%3Aaaid%3Ascds%3AUS%3A60ce3617-169e-3ec8-97cb-7d8c1ef302da" class="plainlink">2022-2023 Undergraduate Student Handbook</a>).
Violations of academic integrity will be reported to <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/osccr/" class="plainlink">OSCCR</a>,
and will have strong consequences on your grade, from an automatic zero on the assignment to failing the course.

    If you are ever unsure of whether sharing is unacceptable or not, or you are struggling in the course, please contact one of
the course staff. We are here to help.
