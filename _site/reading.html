    Things I’ve read
   </h2>
   <p>
    This is a chronological list of some things I’ve been reading, with
brief notes, reflections, impressions, etc. The main criteria for
inclusion are: non-triviality (usually this means some length, but not
always), and interest (so an uninteresting paper or book doesn’t merit
inclusion).
   </p>
   <p>
    Often, clusters of papers are related. This is due to the wonderful
experience of reading research papers, where one paper references
another, so I start reading that instead, but the second paper is
actually based on a third, etc. Finding papers like this (vs.&nbsp;searching
online) is also great because it naturally selects papers that were well
written and/or influential.

     <blockquote>
      <p>
       <em>Another book (~500pgs), this one a pretty concrete tutorial /
reference to the Coq theorem prover. Having taken a course based on the
other main reference to learning Coq, “Software Foundations” (which IS
freely available), I can say definitively that this book is a much
better introduction. It starts from the basics, and explains a lot of
the mechanics of the system while explaining the theory and method of
proving theorems. It becomes pretty reference-like as you move through
(indeed I only read closely the first half), but is extremely clear
throughout. For getting to know Coq (which is still, at this point, the
best supported automated theorem prover), this seems to be the best
reference. I had heard that before, but had not been excited about the
cover price (I’m so spoiled by CS people giving things away for free!).
Let it be stated again - it’s worth the price.</em>

      <p>
       <em>This book (~400pgs) introduces type theory and then applies it to
functional programming. I read the first half throughout April, (through
Chapter 5). It’s a very formal (perhaps obviously) presentation of first
the typed lambda calculus, and then additions that get it more into
dependently typed land. It became dense enough that I put it down for
the time being, as I didn’t feel that I was getting much (concrete) out
of the presentation.</em>

it uses both OCaml and Haskell with real, working examples. The language
syntaxes are module signatures in the former, and type class instances
in the latter. Then the semantics are modules or class instances
respectively.</em>
