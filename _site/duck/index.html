<p>From <a href="http://www.duckworksbbs.com/plans/storer/ozracer_rv/index.htm">these plans</a> (a $20 download).</p>
<h3 id="summary-and-some-notes">Summary and some notes</h3>
<p>There wasn’t much information out there about this build, even though it seems like a lot of people have made them. In particular, I had no idea how long I should expect it to take (and I underestimated how long it would take – the only number I saw was 10 days, which perhaps a professional, or someone with a helper, could do, but not me!). So this page is an attempt to give more information that might be useful to someone taking on this project. In the end, with every step, including a bunch of time spent stripping off poorly adhered paint and repainting (probably around 15hrs lost), to a rigged boat ready to launch, it took <strong>150.75 hours</strong>. As a total amateur.</p>
<p>Also, the plans are pretty detailed, but they aren’t perfect – there are places where they are incomplete, or misleading (e.g., they suggest gluing in the mast step at two different places in the plans – I chose the first one arbitrarily! Even worse, the rudder box instructions say, counter to the pictures, you should glue the framing on <em>after</em> gluing the box together. But if you do that, it’s impossible to drill a countersunk hole on the <em>inside</em> of the rudderbox. So the proposed assembly instructions are essentially impossible) So read everything and try to understand how things fit together – it’s not a matter of just following the instructions in order. However, I am confident that they include enough information that a complete novice (like me) can end up with a boat, but it probably won’t match what is describe exactly, because I don’t think what is describe is actually consistent. Somewhat frustrating, especially given how much love people give to the plan author (as an engineering spec, at least the type I would expect from my entirely different background as a software engineering, I would give it a C-).</p>
<p>Another unclear part is when you should be epoxying things! In the appendix, the author says that they strongly prefer coating surfaces at the point that they are getting glued to other things, but then the instructions (and images) don’t seem to do that. Some surfaces really should be done that way, because then they will become in internal places, but others may be better to wait (I realize now, perhaps the inside of sealed compartments need not have been coated at all! Assuming no leaks, they should never see water, and it would have saved time and weight to not coat them). I ended up coating most everything (on both sides) before assembly, somewhat ignoring the advice that places where pieces will later get attached should get masked off (confusingly, one of the main sources of information, aside from the plans, is this site: <a href="http://www.bitingmidge.com/boats/ozracer/building/oneminute.html">http://www.bitingmidge.com/boats/ozracer/building/oneminute.html</a>, which suggests pre-coating the <em>entire</em> plywood panels. This might have actually been a much better plan, but clearly contradicts the idea that you shouldn’t pre-coat areas that will get glued. It’s also probably somewhat wasteful, as even scrap parts get coated, and it may make things harder to cut, as epoxy makes the wood a lot stronger). I then sanded the panels before they got glued to other parts, and hopefully it’s all strong enough!</p>
<h3 id="tools-used-in-order-of-frequency">Tools Used (in order of frequency):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Drill</li>
<li>Jig Saw</li>
<li>Belt Sander</li>
<li>Orbital Sander</li>
<li>Router</li>
<li>Table saw – to rip lumber to the right dimensions (done all at once the first day, as I didn’t own one when I started this)</li>
<li>Hand plane</li>
<li>Thickness planer (to get the foil blanks to right thickness)</li>
<li>Electric plane</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: I ended up not using the hand plane for any of the initial steps, even though the plans had you using it all the time. The one I bought was crappy and the sharpening guide I bought didn’t fit it, so sharpening was hard. So I used the jig saw / belt sander for most things (cutting down to close, using sander for the rest), and for narrowing the mast pieces which I used the router. For making the foils, however, I ended up using the hand plane for the leading edge. For the trailing edge, I used an electric hand plane, but to get the curve on the leading edge, even the not great hand plane worked much better, with a sander used to clean it up. And then for rounding the yard and shaping the oars, I used it, crappy as it was (lots of tear-out cleaned up by sanding), a LOT.</p>

<p>This was quite a bit more than I was expecting (which, based on things I had read, made me think it’d be about $500). Part of that is probably that I got marine paint, which is expensive, vs. regular outdoor house paint (which probably would have been fine, and probably would have saved ~$80), but also not thinking about all the disposable stuff (brushes, rollers, drop cloths, gloves) which, on it’s own isn’t expensive, but adds up. Finally, the rigging stuff, deck hatches, and rudder hardware is not cheap ($51 for rope &amp; blocks, $35 for rudder stuff, $20 for two 6" hatches)! Those things account for about $300, which combined with probably paying more for lumber than strictly necessary (I got high quality 5/4ths stuff for the foils, which was not cheap, and I probably could have just gotten more 2x4s and ripped them. The plywood was just under $100, and there really wasn’t that much other lumber necessary) and a lot of miscellaneous things (like $8.65 for seam tape for the sail, $5 for high quality thread, etc) account for the “extra”.</p>
<h4 id="extra-cost">Extra cost</h4>
<p>The initial paint job I did both didn’t come out well (I think it was way too hot when I painted it, especially the top, which I did outside in the sun!), and I realized that the color on top really didn’t look right. So I decided to scrape/sand off the paint and repaint it. Since this was turning into a much longer term project, I decided to spend more time researching and decided to paint it with old-school marine paint from the local shop Kirby paints (which has been operating continuously since 1846). It’s a bit more expensive than the original stuff I got, but the colors are a lot nicer. Getting a couple quarts, plus thinner, and some brushes was about another $100.</p>

<img src="../static/boat/boat-1.jpg" /> Getting all the lumber, post stripping it with a table saw my dad had. Without access to a table saw and someone who knows how to use it, I don’t think this project would be possible – the dimensions of lumber needed are <em>not</em> things that are available standard. And, even if they were, they would probably be so much more expensive. For example, I got 12" wide pine planks that were then ripped to get the 3/4" by 3/4" strips, the 3/4" by 1 3/4", etc.
<div class="clear">

</div>
<p><img src="../static/boat/boat-4.jpg" /> Marking side panels (first mistake is present in this photo – third and possibly fourth clamp are not in the right place, and the flexible wood batten was so flexible that I was able to make the shape.

</div>
<p><img src="../static/boat/boat-12.jpg" /> After long and hard day, added mast step / partner, epoxied bottom and with help of dad (<strong>this would not have been possible alone, as we had to wrench it into shape and then put in screws to hold it</strong>), attached bottom (involving a bit of work to get the boat square, and then a lot more work to get the bottom to attach to the sides due to the mistake shaping the bottom; had to add more trim and screw through the bottom to get it to pull up to side panels.)</p>

<div class="clear">

</div>
<p><img src="../static/boat/boat-18.jpg" /> Painted &amp; flipped the boat (it’s gotten heavy! Problem with getting plywood from a local lumberyard is that thinnest they had was 1/4", and I’m sure it’s not the lightest stuff!)</p>

<div class="clear">

</div>
<p><img src="../static/boat/boat-25.jpg" /> Cut bottom of leeboard slot. I noticed what looked like slight gaps at some points around the leeboard case. I’m not sure if they go all the way through to the tank, but I added some thickened epoxy. I’ll have to test the watertightness by dumping water into the tank and see if any comes out!</p>
<div class="clear">

</div>
<p><img src="../static/boat/boat-26.jpg" /> Sewing the sail. This took a long time and a <em>lot</em> of sewing! But the result seemed to come out pretty well, modulo some mistakes (i.e., the tall reinforcing panel that runs most of the way through this photo should have gone higher so the curve at the top hit the top edge of the sail a bit higher than it did).</p>
<div class="clear">

</div>
<p><img src="../static/boat/boat-27.jpg" /> Planing foils. This would have been much easier if my hand plane was better, but I made do by using it on the leading edge (just for the actual curve, which had very narrow shavings that it did better on) and the electric hand planer on the rest, and on the trailing edge. They probably aren’t perfect, but they look pretty good!</p>
