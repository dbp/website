     My Boat
    </h2>
    <p>
     While certainly many details on this site will be relevant to any
variety of Apple 16, some may not, so it’s important to highlight the
boat I’m building:
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
     <li>
      4 plank per side “Apple AHL” as it’s described in some of Tom’s
pages, rather than the 5 plank “Swedish Apple” (or the gaff cutter –
which doesn’t describe the hull, but rather what goes above!). The 5
plank Apple requires 6 sheets of ply for planks, rather than 4 sheets
for the 4 plank Apple: given that the marine ply I’m using (Occume) is
tropical hardwood, minimizing it is a no brainer (I’m sure I would use
off-cuts in the 5 plank version). I was also just amazed by the way that
Tom nested the planks into the sheets, and how that turned into such a
beautiful 3D shape – often the planks would be less than an inch from
each other in multiple places.
     </li>
     <li>
      Single (large) rig, with a small mizzen. This is shown in the
picture on the main page. The plans account for a larger mizzen
“light-air” rig, and corresponding multiple daggerboard positions –
something I did not want to deal with!
     </li>
     <li>
      Pivoting centerboard, rather than a daggerboard. The design in the
plans calls for a long daggerboard case to accommodate the two rig
options, so the centerboard case doesn’t actually take up more room in
the boat. While it isn’t in the plan set (or at least, wasn’t when I
bought them), when I asked Tom about a centerboard he sent me CAD
drawings he had made based on old sketches (for two different options),
so I didn’t actually have to do any designing: his design, conveniently,
had the same slot size in the hull.
     </li>
     <li>
      An enclosed rear tank seat (technically, two rear tanks, with an
open channel for the mizzen step to drain), enclosed bow tank, open rear
side seats and mid-ship thwart, but no seats forward of the middle of
the boat. Related to this—
     </li>
     <li>
      Water ballast, as a tank that runs to the height of the floors from
a little behind the centerboard case to the front of it. Since the hull
starts to get steep around the centerboard case, this ends up being good
use of otherwise not that useful bilge space. This centers the weight
around the lowest point of the hull, and adds a couple hundred pounds
when full. Behind the water ballast, a removable plywood “sole” exists
with large circles cut in it to allow water to drain into the bilge; the
circles also act as foot rests when rowing.
     </li>
     <li>
      The mast partner is a slight deviation: I’m using a mast gate,
similar to how I’ve seen freestanding masts in boats by Francois Vivier
(essentially, an open end on the back, which gets closed by a big rope
across it). As a result of this change, I did deviate a bit in the bow,
as I made the mast partner be part of one continuous king-plank, rather
than one of the plywood options that are in the plans.
     </li>
     <li>
      For the tiller, rather than the curved one that goes around the
mizzen mast, I’m going to put in a Norwegian-style push-pull tiller.
This seems easier, and allows more room for seating further back in the
boat.
     </li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="materials">
     Materials
    </h2>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Plywood: 8 sheets 2500mm x 1225mm (8ft x 4ft “metric”) 6mm
thick.
     </li>
     <li>
      Solid wood: 17ft for gunwales, in &amp; out. 6 strips 20mmx20mm.
Quarter knees, breast hook, and king plank mahogany. 25mm x 25mm douglas
fir for centercase support, and lots of 20mm x 20mm stringers (I had a
disasterous attempt to use way to brittle douglas fir for gunwales, so
had plenty of this stuff), white oak for floors, ipe for floorboards.
Strips of lightweight wood for centerboard and rudder (I used red
cedar).
     </li>
     <li>
      Epoxy: ~8G (this is a rough approximation!)
     </li>
     <li>
      Fiberglass: ?? 3” tape, ?? 2” tape, ?? 50” yards
     </li>
