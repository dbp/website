     About the Campion Apple 16
    </h2>
    <p>
     The Apple 16 is a 15ft 10in lug-yawl designed by Tom Dunderdale of <a href="http://www.campionboats.co.uk/">Campion Boats</a>. The <a href="http://www.campionboats.co.uk/details.html">official webpage</a>
has quite a bit of information about the Apple 16, but it’s sometimes
hard to follow (particularly, there are many links that are not styled
as links! And other links that are only images…).
    </p>
    <p>
     To buy plans, email Tom: <a href="mailto:td@campionboats.co.uk">td@campionboats.co.uk</a>, you can
find the current plan prices here: <a href="http://www.campionboats.co.uk/prices.html">http://www.campionboats.co.uk/prices.html</a>.
Tom is very responsive over email, so getting the plans is very easy
(note the three options: the plain Apple 16, as described on this
website, is the Apple AHL there; the Apple 16 plan set is the regular
Apple includes plans for the gaff cutter, and the Swedish Apple has more
planks).
    </p>
    <h2 id="why-this-site">
     Why This Site
    </h2>
    <p>
     The Apple 16 is an <strong>amazing design</strong>, but for various
reasons it seems to be less popular than other boats that fit into the
same category (general length, weight, etc), even while it seems to have
many advantages (described in <a href="/apple/comparison.html">Comparison</a> section). But, one problem
with building a less popular boat is that there are less community
resources, and it’s harder to understand, before building, what is going
to be involved – hopefully this site, including a detailed log of my own
process, which should give at least rough time estimates (everyone works
at different paces, has different standards, tools, etc), should
help!
    </p>
    <p>
     Also, while Tom is incredibly responsive, the plans themselves can be
somewhat overwhelming once you get past the hull (where the step-by-step
instructions stop) – the issue is that the boat has had tons of
different options added over time (water ballast, 3/4 decking,
floorboards, side tanks, etc, etc), and these all overlap in various
ways in the plan sheets. This does mean, if you want to customize thing,
you can often find guidance in the plans (and if not, Tom is incredibly
helpful), but it can be intimidating. So another goal of this site is to
show how to interpret the plans into a single boat: the one that I’m
building, so that if you want to build a similar one, hopefully you have
to do less pondering than I did. I will also include all of the
communication that I have had with Tom (clarifying details, etc), but of
course the plans themselves you will get from him.
