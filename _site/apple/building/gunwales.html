     The gunwales are pretty easy – my time estimate should be high, as I had a bit of a disaster with the first wood I was trying to use kept breaking.

      Be sure the wood you have bends well, as there is a compound curve near bulkhead 10 that kept breaking the first wood I tried to use (or just steam it).

I cut slots to fit the inwales, but realized later that the inwales will slant up at the end (since the hull is not plumb at the transom, but sloping out), so if you want them to smoothly transition into the quarter knees, the quarter knees should really go with the curved transom, rather than flat, and have the quarter knees match the angle that the inwale will have. But it’s nothing I’m losing sleep over – structurally, they are sound (probably oversized, but they are nice hand-holds).">
