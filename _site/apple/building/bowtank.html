     My version of the bow tank deviated pretty significantly from the plans, as I used a different style mast partner and as a result (and also, to save on plywood), used a lot more solid timber inside the tank. I have the tank top ending at the bulkhead, partly because the square of plywood that I had set aside for this based on suggestion from Tom (500mm x 1100mm) was (I think) for just up until the bulkhead. I’m not actually sure if this is what the short/long foredeck refers to, but given my mast gate is a single piece of hardwood that is supported at multiple places going all the way to the stem, I don’t think that losing the couple inches of ply will have any impact! Obviously in the case of the partner from the plans, it might be more important to have the ply support of the longer foredeck.

     <img src="/static/apple/IMG_1435.jpeg" alt="As mentioned above, and in the Boat section, I decided to use the mast partner design that is on some of Iain Oughtred’s designs. I like the open front, as it allows the mast to be put into the step and then pushed up, rather than needing to slide it into the partner from above. This photo shows the full arrangement dry-fit; the key is that the piece at the bottom left will slide it (and have tension from below with shock cord), rather than being permanently attached.">

To save ply, I cut four separate pieces for the reinforcements, as then they could come out of much smaller pieces of ply vs.&nbsp;if I tried to get a single one (also, easier to cut on the bandsaw without having the middle of a circle to cut out). I made a plywood template for this quarter hatch ring, which I re-used on the stern tank hatches. The hatches themselves are single piece Armstrong; there is an arm that goes on the inside and screwing the hatch closed pulls the arm against the ring, putting pressure on the hatch and the ring around the hatch. Not only should these be actually water-tight, it’s neat that they don’t have anything permanently installed on the boat, so I can “install” 3 of them when I only have one in hand (before hitting the water, I should get the rest!)">

The mirror helped, but still! If I did it again, I would have painted it outside the boat, like I did the tank tops, and then sanded it all the way back to wood where the joints would be, to ensure a strong bond (being worried about the joint was the reason I put it in after epoxy sealing it).">
