      If I could go back and order more plywood, I probably would make the
rear seats into tanks. With the framing and knees, it was probably as
much work or more, and what I have is probably not as strong, doesn’t
have as much flotation, etc. The only upside is that I have rollers, but
they inflate, so the deflated ones could be stored <em>inside</em> the
tanks, along with other stuff!
