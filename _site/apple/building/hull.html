<p>Building the hull is pretty straightforward – while it certainly takes some time, once you get the strakes cut out, it goes together very quickly.</p>
<h4 id="important-notes-read-these-even-if-you-ignore-the-rest">Important Notes (!!! READ THESE EVEN IF YOU IGNORE THE REST !!!)</h4>
<ul>
<li>The offsets where you are marking the points for the strakes are the station marks, which will be used to key the bulkheads, etc. That’s why they are at sometimes odd not-quite even numbers.</li>
<li><p>It is mentioned in the plans, but it is super important (and I missed it!): <strong>mark vertical lines connecting each pair of station points</strong>.</p>
If, like me, you marked on one set of scarfed sheets and then cut through both at once, this means you need to flip one set of strakes over (once you’ve marked the edge on the bottom strakes) and draw the lines on the <em>opposite</em> site as you were marking points on the top (otherwise you’ll have the inside on one side and the outside of the other). This will be critical when you are wiring in the bulkheads, but is also useful just in aligning the panels together.</li>
<li><p>If you don’t need to move the hull while you are doing the glass between the stitches, there is no need to tack with fast epoxy or hot glue. This advice is in the case that you are building in a single car garage (amazing that it can be done) where work can only be done on one side. Otherwise, if you can level and stabilize the boat once it is wired and then do all of the 50mm tape between the wires without disturbing the boat, you can skip that.</p></li>

<img src="https://dbp.io/static/apple/IMG_0254.jpeg" alt="A note about wires: I started out by buying some copper from Duckworks. It often broke on more extreme bends, and I ran out quickly. Since the design calls for glassing between the wires, then removing them, there is no risk of having any wire left in the hull, so I just got rebar wire from the hardware store. It’s pretty heavy gauge – certainly as strong as I needed (I could pull through the plywood before the wire broke). I ended up replacing most of the copper wires when I was tightening up the hull later on. If you were planning on bright finishing the boat, it is perhaps a bad idea, as it did leave a slight black stain, but I’m not, so no issue for me." /><figcaption>A note about wires: I started out by buying some copper from Duckworks.

<p>At this point, sequentially, you will do the <a href="../../apple/building/gunwales.html">Gunwales</a>, before flipping the boat, but I organized the time for the Hull to include all of the glass taping, which happens over the course of two more flips.</p>

<p>Again, while working on the outer seams, it makes sense to do the <a href="../../apple/building/hull.html">Outer stem</a>. Technically, it could probably be deferred to later, but this is the order Tom suggests, and I don’t see any reason not to. This is also when he suggested to install the centercase (cutting the slot from the top and bringing the case up from underneath), glassing the hull, and putting on the skeg, but I <em>did</em> defer all of those things.</p>

<p>At this point, the hull is quite strong – it’ll obviously get stronger from knees, thwarts, tanks, floors, etc, and I haven’t felt confident getting into it (but also have been able to reach from the side for everything I’ve needed). Also, as additional (unintentional) confirmation: before building support cradles onto my saw horses, I accidentally dropped the back of the boat off onto the concrete floor (so, about an 18&quot; drop). There was no damage anywhere, which is good!</p>
