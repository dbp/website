     This is a pretty short part of the process, but the breasthook is one of the most visible parts of the boat!

     Important Notes (!!! READ THESE EVEN IF YOU IGNORE THE REST !!!)
    </h4>
    <ul>
     <li>
      If you want to have a chamfered lower section of the stem (to cut through the water better), figure out that shape before you glue the wood on the boat: I tried a chamfer and it looked quite bad, so ended up laminating back on strips of khaya to build back to something big enough that I could trim to a square stem.

This ends where the centerboard slot begins. When I was doing this, I wasn’t sure if the centerboard would require a different sized slot (I thought I was going to need to design it myself, rather than getting a design from Tom), so diverged from the plans and flipped the boat, deferring the rest of the bottom stuff (glassing, skeg), until later. With what I know now, I would probably do the ordinary sequence, building the centercase at this point.">
