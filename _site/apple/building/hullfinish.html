      The designer mentions you could have a single continuous keel running all the way front to back. I didn’t do that, but regretted it once trying to use this on trailer rollers. I’m planning on replacing the rollers with a single plank, which will eliminate the problem (essentially, the discontinuous pieces of keel bump up and down over the rollers), but if you aren’t, I’d aim to avoid the problem by having the forward keel connect to that on either side of the centercase, and have that in turn connect to the skeg.
