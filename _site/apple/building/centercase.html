      As mentioned in the <a href="/apple/boat.html">Boat</a> section, not
only am I putting in a pivoting centerboard (with design provided by
Tom), but I’m using the removable centerboard design popular in Francois
Vivier’s boats, where there is a slot in the side of the case where a
pin that protrudes from the side of the board comes out.
