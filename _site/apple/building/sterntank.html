      You (probably) need to install the rudder post before gluing in the mizzen partner, assuming you want to screw in from the inside in addition to gluing on the outside (as is suggested by the designer). The design for the rear tank I used keeps this area accessible, in theory, but it is a <em>lot</em> harder to get to once the partner (and then tank top) is on.

Tom suggested in the case of a centerboard, this would be better, and Matt Bowser described issues he’d had with the entire rudder popping off (rather than kicking up) with the raked rudder. I used ~30mm maple that I had, which is perhaps not ideal boat building wood, but it’ll be entirely encapsulated in epoxy and paint, and it certainly is hard! I put three screws in from the inside by first drilling holes along the (marked) centerline from the outside and then holding the rudder post on as square as possible and drilling from the inside out into the rudder post. Once that was on, the mizzen partner went on, making the screws a lot harder to get to.">

I didn’t bother to paint over the fillets, but I did use pure silica as the thickener so that it somewhat blended in to the off-white paint! Then it is time to glue on the tank top, after coating every exposed stringer with thickened epoxy. Since getting inside the tanks to clean up squeeze out would be difficult at best, I didn’t put a ton of epoxy on; obviously I want good connections, but if there were tiny gaps it isn’t a huge deal. Indeed, only at the front edge and along the middle ahead of the partner would it compromise the tank watertightness, since the upper edge will be filleted around the outer edge.">
