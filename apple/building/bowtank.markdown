**Total Time: 27 hours**

My version of the bow tank deviated pretty significantly from the plans, as I
used a different style mast partner and as a result (and also, to save on
plywood), used a lot more solid timber inside the tank. I have the tank top
ending at the bulkhead, partly because the square of plywood that I had set
aside for this based on suggestion from Tom (500mm x 1100mm) was (I think) for
just up until the bulkhead. I'm not actually sure if this is what the short/long
foredeck refers to, but given my mast gate is a single piece of hardwood that is
supported at multiple places going all the way to the stem, I don't think that
losing the couple inches of ply will have any impact! Obviously in the case of
the partner from the plans, it might be more important to have the ply support
of the longer foredeck.

### Photos of building sequence, with notes

![As mentioned above, and in the [Boat](/apple/boat.html) section, I decided to use the mast partner design that is on some of Iain Oughtred's designs. I like the open front, as it allows the mast to be put into the step and then pushed up, rather than needing to slide it into the partner from above. This photo shows the full arrangement dry-fit; the key is that the piece at the bottom left will slide it (and have tension from below with shock cord), rather than being permanently attached.](/static/apple/IMG_1435.jpeg)

![Not visibly in the above photo is a knee that I added, matching the knee in the plans, though I made mine out of douglas fir instead of plywood](/static/apple/IMG_1437.jpeg)

<div style="clear: both"></div>

![I made the tank top patterns out of cardboard, scribing with a compass a fixed distance from the hull, cutting, and then repeating. Since the other side of the hull gets in the way (you can't start with a big enough piece of cardboard), this had to be done with small pieces of cardboard and then taped together. This gets plenty of accuracy, especially given that the edges are going to be hidden with a fillet eventually anyway](/static/apple/IMG_1449.jpeg)

<div style="clear: both"></div>

![I cut a hole for a hatch on one side, and added reinforcements. To save ply, I cut four separate pieces for the reinforcements, as then they could come out of much smaller pieces of ply vs. if I tried to get a single one (also, easier to cut on the bandsaw without having the middle of a circle to cut out). I made a plywood template for this quarter hatch ring, which I re-used on the stern tank hatches. The hatches themselves are single piece Armstrong; there is an arm that goes on the inside and screwing the hatch closed pulls the arm against the ring, putting pressure on the hatch and the ring around the hatch. Not only should these be actually water-tight, it's neat that they don't have anything permanently installed on the boat, so I can "install" 3 of them when I only have one in hand (before hitting the water, I should get the rest!)](/static/apple/IMG_1516.jpeg)

![After three coats of epoxy, I put on two coats  System 3 epoxy primer (shown here)](/static/apple/IMG_1598.jpeg)

<div style="clear: both"></div>

![And 3-4 coats of paint (3 was plenty on the underside of the tank tops, which were smooth; I didn't do the best job smoothing out the inside of the tanks, so it took 4 coats to really get the color uniform). Painting the underside of the king plank was a total pain -- probably, I should have just not bothered (it really didn't matter; it was epoxy sealed, and the only reason I was painting the tanks at all was to make it easier to see inside them, which means the primer would probably have been plenty). The mirror helped, but still! If I did it again, I would have painted it outside the boat, like I did the tank tops, and then sanded it all the way back to wood where the joints would be, to ensure a strong bond (being worried about the joint was the reason I put it in after epoxy sealing it).](https://dbp.io/static/apple/IMG_1654.jpeg)

![I added lots of weights to hold everything together after glueing, but honestly, the few screws I put in did a lot better job; I should probably have just stuck to them.](/static/apple/IMG_1670.jpeg)

![Then, once everything was dry, some clean up, some fillets on the top, and the tank is essentially done for now](/static/apple/IMG_1721.jpeg)
