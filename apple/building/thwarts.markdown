About this part

#### Important Notes (!!! READ THESE EVEN IF YOU IGNORE THE REST !!!)

- If I could go back and order more plywood, I probably would make the rear seats into tanks. With the framing and knees, it was probably as much work or more, and what I have is probably not as strong, doesn't have as much flotation, etc. The only upside is that I have rollers, but they inflate, so the deflated ones could be stored _inside_ the tanks, along with other stuff!

![In order to have floorboards that run out to the side thwarts, my floors more-or-less follow the second chine. Since I didn't have any plywood left, I cut them out of 18mm white oak.](/static/apple/IMG_7006.jpeg)

![They support floorboards that run up to station 7 -- leaving forward of that as a wet-locker of sorts (for anchor, etc). ](/static/apple/IMG_7047.jpeg)

![The rear thwarts have knees that leave room for beach rollers to be tied underneath, where they serve as flotation.](/static/apple/IMG_7029.jpeg)

![All the knees are laminated out of two layers of 6mm plywood, sometimes "double sawn" as I was, at this point, truly running out of plywood (note the thwarts themselves are multiple pieces glassed together)](/static/apple/IMG_7112.jpeg)

![Underneath the side thwarts are two knees that line up with the floors; above is one in the middle, hopefully not making things too uncomfortable!](/static/apple/IMG_7514.jpeg)

![Final layout (much later)! Innermost floorboard is held down by toggles, so to be able to pump out bilge if it doesn't drain forward, and generally store and/or get stuff out. Rest are screwed down.](/static/apple/IMG_8506.jpeg)
